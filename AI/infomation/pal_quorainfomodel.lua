Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersIncorrect: Listening to loud music slowly gives me a headache.Correct: When I listen to loud music, I slowly develop a headache.A squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!

Of these two, I will only describe the method of preparation of the polyvinylalcohol based slime as this is by far the preferred formulation. The first step is to produce a 4% solution of polyvinylalcohol. Do you need to start with 99+% hydrolysed polyvinylalcohol in the 30–60,000 molecular weight range. Add enough of the polyvinylalcohol to a beaker of deionized water (or a microwavable yes with a microwave compatible cover) to prepare a 4% solution of polyvinylalcohol. Polyvinyl alcohol must be heated to near boiling in order to dissolve. It will not dissolve at room temperature no matter how long you stir the mixture. Heat the solution until the solution is just beginning to boil and then reduce the heat so that it is just slightly boiling for 5 to 10 minutes with stirring. After the solution is clear and homogeneous, remove from heat and cover the solution while it cools. Separately, make a 4% solution or borax in deionized water. With stirring it will eventually dissolve, although it will dissolve much faster if you heat it up a bit. The slime is prepared by mixing 5-10 mL of the 4% borax solution (depending upon the desired viscosity) to 50 mL of the 4% polyvinylalcohol solution.

If youre tying a bow on the top of a package, loop the ribbon under the package, bring the ends together over the package and knot the two ends together so the ends are equal in length. You now have a right side and a left side to work with. You can tie a bow from a piece of ribbon that isnt attached to a package. Tie a knot in the center of the ribbon so the left and right sides are equal in length. 2. Make a loop with the left side of the ribbon. Pinch the loop between your thumb and forefinger to hold it in place. If youre tying a ribbon, make sure that it isnt twisted; the loop should be smooth. 3. Make a second loop. This time bring the right side of the ribbon around and under the left loop. Pull it through until you have a second loop of the exact same size. Use the same technique you use when you tie your shoes. 4. Tighten the bow. Pull on the loops to tighten the knot at their center. Make sure the two loops are the same size and that the ends are even in length. The bow is complete. Method 2 of 3:Tying a Looped Bow1. Start with a long piece of ribbon.For this bow, cut a piece of ribbon about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. Leave it straight and unknotted. 2. Make a loop near the left end of the bow. Start about three inches from the end of the bow and make a loop. Hold it in place with your thumb and forefinger. 3. Loop the right end over the loop to create a second loop. The ribbon should now look like a backwards S with a tail at either end. Hold the loops with one hand so they dont come undone. 4. Continue looping the ribbon. Loop the remaining length of ribbon accordion style, so that you have a pile of loops with two ends of equal length sticking out from either side. 5. Cinch the center. Use a piece of florist wire or a thin string to tie the loops together at the center, dividing them in two. You now have a pile of loops on the right side of the cinch and a pile of loops on the left side. 6. Fluff the loops. Separate the loops and fluff them up so that the cinched center is no longer visible. Use a scissors to clip the ends into inverted v shapes for a professional touch. Method 3 of 3:Tying a Floral Bow1. Wrap a piece of ribbon around your hand. Hold the end against your palm with your thumb, and continue wrapping the ribbon until the entire piece has been wrapped. Each loop around your hand should be neatly placed on top of the previous loop. 2. Slip the ribbon loops off of your hand and fold them in half. Be careful not to let the loops come undone when you slip them off. 3. Cut the cinch. Hold the folded loop in one hand so that the center folded part is facing up. With the other hand, use a scissors to cut the corner off of either side of the cinch, the folded middle. Make sure you cut through all of the ribbon layers. Use a careful, firm snip of the scissors to ensure the cut is even and none of the layers slip. Dont cut the two corners too close to the center of the ribbon. 4. Use a second ribbon to tie the cinch. Fit the second ribbon between the notches you cut in the middle of the loops and tie a knot there. You can also use florist wire or a small string. 5.

You just need a ribbon with a left end and a right end stemming from the same knotted center. If youre tying a bow on the top of a package, loop the ribbon under the package, bring the ends together over the package and knot the two ends together so the ends are equal in length.

You just need a ribbon with a left end and a right end stemming from the same knotted center. If youre tying a bow on the top of a package, loop the ribbon under the package, bring the ends together over the package and knot the two ends together so the ends are equal in length. You now have a right side and a left side to work with. You can tie a bow from a piece of ribbon that isnt attached to a package. Tie a knot in the center of the ribbon so the left and right sides are equal in length. 2. Make a loop with the left side of the ribbon. Pinch the loop between your thumb and forefinger to hold it in place. If youre tying a ribbon, make sure that it isnt twisted; the loop should be smooth. 3. Make a second loop. This time bring the right side of the ribbon around and under the left loop. Pull it through until you have a second loop of the exact same size. Use the same technique you use when you tie your shoes. 4. Tighten the bow. Pull on the loops to tighten the knot at their center. Make sure the two loops are the same size and that the ends are even in length. The bow is complete. Method 2 of 3:Tying a Looped Bow1. Start with a long piece of ribbon.For this bow, cut a piece of ribbon about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. Leave it straight and unknotted. 2. Make a loop near the left end of the bow. Start about three inches from the end of the bow and make a loop. Hold it in place with your thumb and forefinger. 3. Loop the right end over the loop to create a second loop. The ribbon should now look like a backwards S with a tail at either end. Hold the loops with one hand so they dont come undone. 4. Continue looping the ribbon. Loop the remaining length of ribbon accordion style, so that you have a pile of loops with two ends of equal length sticking out from either side. 5. Cinch the center. Use a piece of florist wire or a thin string to tie the loops together at the center, dividing them in two. You now have a pile of loops on the right side of the cinch and a pile of loops on the left side. 6. Fluff the loops. Separate the loops and fluff them up so that the cinched center is no longer visible. Use a scissors to clip the ends into inverted v shapes for a professional touch. Method 3 of 3:Tying a Floral Bow1. Wrap a piece of ribbon around your hand. Hold the end against your palm with your thumb, and continue wrapping the ribbon until the entire piece has been wrapped. Each loop around your hand should be neatly placed on top of the previous loop. 2. Slip the ribbon loops off of your hand and fold them in half. Be careful not to let the loops come undone when you slip them off. 3. Cut the cinch. Hold the folded loop in one hand so that the center folded part is facing up. With the other hand, use a scissors to cut the corner off of either side of the cinch, the folded middle. Make sure you cut through all of the ribbon layers. Use a careful, firm snip of the scissors to ensure the cut is even and none of the layers slip. Dont cut the two corners too close to the center of the ribbon. 4. Use a second ribbon to tie the cinch. Fit the second ribbon between the notches you cut in the middle of the loops and tie a knot there. You can also use florist wire or a small string. 5. Fan out the loops. Separate the loops one by one from the inside to the outside. Pull the loops gently from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange the loops so that they form a petal-like circular pattern. The floral bow is now complete. 6.

Lift up your collar.Though a bow tie can be tied with the collar either up or down, you’ll have a much easier time seeing what you’re doing with the collar up, so lift it and ensure the top button of your shirt is buttoned. 2. Measure your neck. Stand up straight and use a tailor’s measuring tape to measure your neck starting from the base of the back of your neck and ending in the front where your collar sits at just around your Adam’s apple. Place an index finger between the tape as well to give yourself some breathing room. 3. Size the bow tie. Bow ties are oContinue ReadingPart 1 of 3:Measuring the Bow Tie1.

Measure your neck. Stand up straight and use a tailor’s measuring tape to measure your neck starting from the base of the back of your neck and ending in the front where your collar sits at just around your Adam’s apple. Place an index finger between the tape as well to give yourself some breathing room. 3. Size the bow tie. Bow ties are one size fits all, but they have ways to adjust the length either with a slider or button holes. Most bow ties will also have pre-marked neck measurements informing you how to size them based on your neck measurement. Move the slider or buttons based on your neck measurement. 4. Place the bow tie around your neck. Like tying a regular necktie, one end of the bow tie needs to drape over your chest longer than the other. Position the bow tie so that one end hangs roughly 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lower than the other end. Part 2 of 3:Tying the Bow Tie1. Cross the longer end over the shorter end. You should cross the tie near your neck so that the loop around your neck is just large enough to work with but not loose; you don’t want your bow dangling in front of your chest. 2. Loop the long end under where the two ends cross. With one hand hold the point where the two ends cross over the front of your collar. Take the dangling portion of the longer end and pass it behind and then up over the point of intersection. At this point, you can pull both ends of the bow tie to make it as tight around your neck as you will be comfortable with. Once you have the bow tie at the proper tightness, toss the longer end back over your respective shoulder. You won’t need it for the next step. 3. Fold the dangling end to make a loop. Lift up the shorter end—which is still dangling—and fold it over on itself at the widest part of the bowed shape. Lift the whole portion and turn it 90 degrees, so it faces horizontal. This will form a loop that points to the same side as the shoulder over which the longer end is resting. Hold this fold together at the skinniest part of the bow tie, which should be just in front of your Adam’s apple. 4. Drop the longer end over the skinny center of the bow. Take the longer end off your shoulder and drape it over the skinniest part of the bow section you created in the last step. 5. Pinch the bow together in front of the long end. Grab the left and right sides of the horizontally folded end and pinch them together in front of the dangling end. The top of the dangling end will now be held between them. 6. Feed the middle of the dangling end back through the knot. Part 3 of 3:Finishing the Bow Tie1. Pull at the loops. Pulling at the flat ends of the bow tie will simply untie it like pulling on the dangling strings of shoelaces, so make sure you tighten the bow tie by pulling gently at the looped portions. 2. Straighten the bow tie.As soon as you finish, the bow tie will likely be crooked, but you can easily twist the loop at the front and back bows to get it into the proper position. 3. Lower your collar. Your bow tie is now perfectly tied and positioned, so you can put down your collar and finish getting ready. 4. Check the bow tie periodically.Since you can’t double-knot a bow tie like you can your shoes, they loosen over the course of wear and can even come untied. Check your bow tie periodically to ensure it’s still tight and perfectly positioned.","art 1 of 3:Measuring the Bow Tie1.

In fact, the northern lights are produced by the charged particles that leak around to the dark side of the planet, so I’m not sure that this possibility has been ruled out. When one considers the similarities between light and charged particles, maybe the distinction isn’t all that important.A beam of charged particles glows blue when it is in contact with air. What if the sky is blue because Cerenkov light is emitted when charged particles from the solar wind travel faster than the average speed of light in the atmosphere? If the atmosphere is treated as a continuous medium instead of as a collection of discrete scattering centers, perhaps this could be an equally valid explanation. Gravity bends light, so it has an index of refraction relative to gravity-free space and, in this context, the solar wind doesn’t have to be moving at a ridiculous speed to emit blue, Cerenkov light when the gravitational field of our planet slows it down. Going one step further, when the charged particles’ trajectory is bent by the Earth’s magnetic field, it is more appropriate to call the resulting radiation synchrotron light rather than Cerenkov light. Two forms of radiation result from deceleration of a charged particle: Cerenkov radiation from charged particles traveling faster than light in water. Synchrotron radiation from charged particles’ trajectory bending in a magnet. Perhaps this concept can be inverted to give us yet another explanation. What if we imagine the molecules in our atmosphere moving relative to a gravity-free reference frame. They create a sort of optical grating which polarizes and filters the light from the sun as it travels through the aetheric, blue, electromagnetic wakes trailing behind by the molecules. Backing up a bit, we now have four, independent explanations for one thing. The sky is blue becauseshorter wavelengths scatter off of molecules in the atmospherecharged particles scatter off of molecules in the atmosphereCerenkov radiation and synchrotron radiationair molecules trace out aetheric wakes which filter solar lightOnly one of these explanations is well-supported by the scientific literature, but since it is possible for multiple, independent explanations to be true at the same time, we often choose our favorite explanation based on simplicity and predictive power, qualities which depend on perspective.

Now if you just count Homo Sapiens as that is what we are and the only surviving species of the genus then we turn up somewhere around 50,000 BC (according the above article). Although if you look into the subject of the first homo sapiens that is a little late. Early Modern Homo sapiens This article looks at some of the dating and the date is actually 200,000 BP roughly so thats 188,000 BC ish. That means that the number calculated above misses roughly 75% of the time humans (homo sapiens anyway) have existed.  What is also interesting is the connection between modern humans and Neanderthals. There is some evidence that they intermixed This would then beg the question do we count Neanderthals or any hybrid offspring etc. To make it simpler though we should consider that it is just Homo Sapiens that we are looking at and any consequences of mixing with Neanderthals is but a blip on the calculation.  The above article cites the UN as their source for the definition although I havent been able to verify this. If the original date of the article is anything to go by though then it may well be an outdated estimate.  The next thing that you need to consider is the birth rate. Well that is just as difficult. Recording the data seems to have only started in 1960 in Europe at any rate. Fertility statistics. So we have about 50 years of data and 200,000 to extrapolate it over! Well there is the population sizes that we have dotted around history where we can correlate all of the data and look at it. Roman Census Figures that link is very useful for numbers. What you do have though is the little bit at the bottom. The numbers may be completely wrong. They can only really be used as a guide. The original article also brings up the issue of infant mortality. When you have a census in a modern country the time between them is roughly 10 years. Now that means that anyone born after the census who then dies before the next census will not appear on any census. The data for those people is on registers of births. Now consider that historical societies were stratified heavily. Look at ancient Athens the Democracy only enfranchised a small group of people other groups didnt count. The same in the Roman empire which led to changes in the definition of the term citizen for the military as they were running out of people. I have digressed a little but it shows that the data we have is sketchy at best.  The rates of birth they set were at 80 per 1000 then 60 per thousand finally reducing to about 30 per 1000. Even the reasoning behind these rates could be disputed. Particularly the reason for the high birth rates. While there may have been high infant mortality that doesnt automatically mean that people have more children. Low technology agricultural groups tend to have the highest birth rates as they need large families to work on the farms. Disease also spreads slower where you have dispersed populations therefore killing less people. So with all of those issues what do we have? At the very least another 150,000 years of birth rates need to be added. before the chart. it suggests that there were just over 1 billion births in 42000 years at the very least this estimate needs to be multiplied by a factor of 3.57. that would instantly add another 2.5 billion people to the total. We arent talking about a concept like that though. The numbers grow with the size of the population. So considering that there was only a birth rate equal enough to replace the existing population then yes add 2.5 billion. Tip that slightly over and you are looking at a lot more. The birth rates in the modern part of their graph show that over a fifty year time period with a reduction in the birth rate by about 10% there were over twice as many births. So I wouldnt hesitate to add a lot more to the total that has been originally touted. As for that exact number I would have to dedicate several years of scholarly research which Im sure would be too long to form an answer here. At the very least that 107 billion number is 5 years out of date at the modern end and also discounts a potential 150000 years of human history at the other end.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersIncorrect: Listening to loud music slowly gives me a headache.Correct: When I listen to loud music, I slowly develop a headache.A squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!

It can cause both physical and psychological problems including permanent scarring of the skin, poor self-image, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. However, let me tell you... THERE IS NO QUICK FIX TO ACNE! There...band-aid ripped off! The path to clear skin is often one of trial and error; you might need to try several acne remedies before you find the right treatment for the types of acne affecting your skin. Before trying acne medication, you may prefer to give different natural acne treatment options a chance. While theres no research supporting the effective use of natural acne treatments, here are two popular options that you may want to try. 1. Coconut Oil Coconut oil is all the rage, with uses ranging from hair conditioning to cooking. But some swear by it as a natural acne treatment. To use coconut oil as an acne treatment, you can include it as part of a healthy diet. Or, you can apply a very small amount and rub directly onto your skin after cleansing for an extra hydrating boost. 2. Tea Tree Oil Some people swear by the disinfecting power of tea tree oil for acne treatment. It can be applied either full strength or slightly diluted with water directly onto pimples. Use a small amount on a clean cotton swab or cotton pad and dab on the affected areas immediately after cleansing. Because tea tree oil can be drying, you might choose to use both tea tree oil and coconut oil for acne as part of your clear skin regimen. Disclaimer: While the home remedies may not be enough to give you clear skin, especially in those with complicated, inflammatory cystic acne. There are several acne medication options approved for use, but which one is best for you is a question for your dermatologist. Here are a few of the acne treatments you can consider:Acne Control Protocol (For Active Acne and Acne Pigmentation)A combination of personalized medical treatment and fortnightly cleanup sessions for 3 months takes care of active acne and reddish brown acne pigmentation. Severe acne may need a Comedone buster, like a ‘Carbon peel’ which is the latest addition to the treatment protocol.Acne Scar ProtocolWe have the world’s most effective Ultrapulse Total FX laser technology for acne scars. Unlike most skin treatments that require repeated appointments to achieve optimal results, the Ultrapulse Total FX laser treatment reduces the appearance of wrinkles, and scars. We understand how much acne can affect your life and especially your self-confidence. With our years of medical experience in treating a variety of skin problems, our super specialists create bespoke plans for all skin types.

I cant stress enough how significant persistence is, regardless of the quality of the drawings. Which leads me to...Dont worry about quality. A fascinating aspect of art that Ive noticed is that it doesnt take an artist to notice something off in a piece of artwork. Because youre just starting off, you will NOT like a lot of the stuff you draw. A lot of people I know gave up learning to draw early because they couldnt stand how nothing ever came out right. Let me just tell you as an artist of 10+ years now, we ALL started that way. It doesnt have to be good, you just need to learn something from it. So lastly on the topic of mindset...Be persistent. You mentioned you had a ton of paper and strong willpower. Good. Youll need both. And Im willing to bet youll need even more paper than you have. Practice daily. Especially practice drawing the things youre interested in drawing. In your case, draw people as you see them in real life. I know you want to draw anime style, but trust me, learning the basic structure of the human face will still translate into an exaggerated style like anime. Yeesh, this is already a long answer. But I suppose youre not obligated to read it all, so lets continue by going over the most basic of drawing techniques. All drawing, regardless of style are rooted in some pretty fundamental principles. These are the skill sets you will need to acquire no matter what discipline youre approaching, I could teach a 6 hour course on these, but Ill just do what I consider the two most important here: Line. When I say line here, I mean two things: quality of line, and just learning to draw good lines. Ive met many people who, while learning to draw, make these little chicken scratch lines. Compare the first circle to the second one:See how lousy that first one looks? And yet a ton of beginning artists think they can be more precise by drawing tiny little line segments. It might feel awkward at first, but learn to be confident in your lines, and keep the pencil moving.Shape. Youve probably heard this before, but everything is composed of basic shapes at their core. They might not be all regular shapes, but if you can create an outline of your drawing using simple shapes before getting into the details of any one part, youll have an easier time getting the overall look correctly proportioned.This isnt a perfect drawing, but its a good starting point. From here you can easily make changes to refine and add detail to your drawing.Whoo boy, almost done. You must be dedicated if youve read this far. Because youre going for an anime style, youre in luck. There are TONS of great resources out there that teach the Japanese anime/manga style. My personal favorite is Mark Crilley over on Youtube. Hes a professional manga artist with several published books, but he also does tutorials online teaching everything from faces to body structures within the anime/manga style. Heres a link: markcrilley. Peruse his channel for any length of time and youre bound to learn something. You also mentioned how in looking at other peoples art, there is often a ridiculous amount of detail. Sorry to say that each of those details is something of a mastery in and of themselves. Shading and lighting are a whole other lesson. Folds in clothing are as well. Id browse the Quora Drawing section for more good questions and answers regarding these things, as this answer is already getting stupidly long. But the thing I love about Quora is you can just keep asking questions. Practice the things Ive talked about here to start, and then ask more questions once youve gotten the hang of it. If you read this whole thing, thank you for listening to me ramble, and I wish you the best of luck. tl;dr: Draw a lot, dont worry about the results, learn to be fluid when drawing your lines, everything is composed of basic shapes, Mark Crilley is awesome for learning anime/manga style.

THERE IS NO QUICK FIX TO ACNE! There...band-aid ripped off! The path to clear skin is often one of trial and error; you might need to try several acne remedies before you find the right treatment for the types of acne affecting your skin. Before trying acne medication, you may prefer to give different natural acne treatment options a chance. While theres no research supporting the effective use of natural acne treatments, here are two popular options that you may want to try. 1. Coconut Oil Coconut oil is all the rage, with uses ranging from hair conditioning to cooking. But some swear by it as a natural acne treatment. To use coconut oil as an acne treatment, you can include it as part of a healthy diet. Or, you can apply a very small amount and rub directly onto your skin after cleansing for an extra hydrating boost. 2. Tea Tree Oil Some people swear by the disinfecting power of tea tree oil for acne treatment. It can be applied either full strength or slightly diluted with water directly onto pimples. Use a small amount on a clean cotton swab or cotton pad and dab on the affected areas immediately after cleansing. Because tea tree oil can be drying, you might choose to use both tea tree oil and coconut oil for acne as part of your clear skin regimen. Disclaimer: While the home remedies may not be enough to give you clear skin, especially in those with complicated, inflammatory cystic acne. There are several acne medication options approved for use, but which one is best for you is a question for your dermatologist. Here are a few of the acne treatments you can consider:Acne Control Protocol (For Active Acne and Acne Pigmentation)A combination of personalized medical treatment and fortnightly cleanup sessions for 3 months takes care of active acne and reddish brown acne pigmentation.

Unlike most skin treatments that require repeated appointments to achieve optimal results, the Ultrapulse Total FX laser treatment reduces the appearance of wrinkles, and scars.

Here is how to cook spaghetti squash in oven with 4 different flavours – think pizza, pad Thai, chicken alfredo and taco spaghetti squash boats! These recipes for spaghetti squash will keep the flavours of your meal exciting and delicious! Spaghetti squash cut : How to cut spaghetti squash For each of these spaghetti squash recipes, you will have to cut your squash in half. The exterior skin of the squash is very tough, but there is a trick that will make the work much easier. With a sharp knife, make a few slits in the squash where you plan to cut, like you are making a dotted line around the outside.

If the eggs have been refrigerated, you will want to put them in a porcelain or glass bowl, whisk them, place in a microwave for eight seconds, whisk, and repeat until the eggs are warm. This seems finicky, but cold eggs are infernally difficult to mix together and microwave heating tends to be uneven when the eggs are not mixed well. Alternatively, use an electric beater to mix cold eggs completely and nuke for nine seconds per egg until just warm to the touch.3. Sauté the filling ingredients. First, try not to select more than two or three ingredients aside from cheese. Make sure that wet ingredients such as mushrooms and tomatoes get cooked long enough for the flavors to intensify and the surfaces to cease being watery.4.

Near the end of half a minute there will be a little liquid on the top. Tilt the pan to run this liquid to the edges.5. The moment there is no more liquid, add the hot filling ingredients, fold, and top with cheese. Move to a warmed plate and let rest about half a minute. Consider a dash of a hot sauce such as Cholula. Or some green salsa. Or just a dash of dried chervil. Here are some ideas for fillings. 1. Ham and cheese. A simple classic. Use a good sharp cheddar or a swiss cheese and a juicy ham with a good smokey flavor. Sometimes tomatoes or bell peppers can be added.2. Spinach and mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms under high heat until they get some color. Then toss in the spinach, adding enough salt to offstet its bitterness, a few pinches. I top this with swiss or gruyere cheese.3. Shrimp and avocado. The shrimp will have been precooked by boiling or steaming, and the avocado gets no cooking at all. Heat shrimp in olive oil with a touch of smoked paprika.4.

Mexican girls typically come from Catholic backgrounds, so if you’re interested in Mexican girls simply because you expect her to jump into bed with you after the first date, don’t, because she most likely won’t. Yes our culture is passionate but sex is still sex and we’re not all like the Latinas portrayed on tv that are willing to give it to you the moment you meet us, but once we do it’s probably going to seem like the stereotypes of “amazing sex” is true simply for the fact that we are open to trying new things, use it as a love language, and not only want to please our partner but ourselves as well. We take pride in our sexuality and femininity, but it’s important to remember we aren’t there to play into your fetish or fantasy many men seem to have about Latinas.Most Mexican girls will know how to drink and love to party because we’ve been conditioned from a young age to do so, meaning you’ll definitely never be bored and will be dragged to many family parties. Mexican parties are well known for being some of the best consisting of amazing food, tequila, cumbias, rancheras, etc. So have fun!A lot of Mexican girls take pride in their appearance and actually enjoy looking good not only for their partner but just to feel confident in general, so don’t be surprised if your girl wears heels simply to go shopping, many of us were put in them before we could even walk!You will most likely pick up on some Spanish as most Mexican girls come from a Spanish speaking background and use it within their families. Spanish is a beautiful language and I suggest trying to learn it if you are in a serious relationship with a Mexican girl (or Latina in general) as it would definitely win you some points with her AND the family, and believe me most of us care deeply of what our parents think.Our culture is passionate so don’t be surprised if a Mexican girl is more affectionate then you’re used to, many may show their love through cooking, dancing, touching, kissing, etc it’s how we express ourselves, so just enjoy it :)“I’m not yelling, I’m Mexican” We can be very loud at times and are not shy about expressing our feelings, I suppose this is where the “hot tempered spicy Latina” stereotype comes from, this can be a win or lose situation as we will express if we are happy or unhappy, but at least you won’t have to guess how we’re feeling and tiptoe around our emotions.We have a caballero (gentleman) expectation! Our culture is very traditional and many of us grew up with specific gender roles, this means that a man is expected to act courteous, polite, and respectful, even if it’s simple acts such as opening the door for us, walking on the side closest to the street, sending flowers, etc. Girls want to date Mexican men because they treat their girls like reinas (queens), in fact this is how many Hispanic men refer to their women (“mi reina”) so don’t forget to treat your girl the way she should be, because their is always someone from our own community who will be willing to do it for you.You’ll NEVER be hungry. Most Mexican girls love to eat, it’s one of the best aspects of our culture and for good reason. It ranges from tacos, pozole, burritos, tamales, flautas, etc. Many of us know how to cook and usually like to do it, so cooking for our man is not really seen as an obligation but more of a way to express how much we care for them and keeping their stomachs satisfied. If your girls doesn’t cook, she’ll probably take you to all the locations she knows knows, which tend to be hidden gems with amazing food!As stated above we come from a traditional background that can be conservative. This means that typically your woman will live with her parents so don’t expect for her to be staying the night at yours all the time, and if you plan on taking any trips with her she will most likely lie about who she’s going with. Staying the night at her house is a no, in most Hispanic families that won’t fly and is viewed as very disrespectful. While Mexican girls may be extremely affectionate with you in private and even in public, it’s a different story in front of our families, we behave ourselves and don’t typically participate in PDA, so don’t try to be all up on her while her family is present unless she actually tells you it’s not a problem, because most of the time it will be. (*Cough cough, play positions by Ariana Grande*)FAMILY IS KEY. One of the most important aspects in Mexican culture is our value of family. We are taught to respect our elders, and to outsiders it may seem as if Mexicans (or Latinos in general) are very attached to their families. But remember this, what her family thinks of you will greatly impact your future, so don’t think it’s going to be like dating a girl (from another background) that ignores what her family thinks because it’s “her life”. Also it’s important to realize she may introduce you to her family pretty early on because the sooner she gets their approval the sooner she can decide where the relationship is going, and this may not only consist of her parents it may also be her uncles, aunts, grandparents, etc, each individual’s opinion is actually important so be prepared. It’s also very important to realize just because she’s introducing you to her family early on doesn’t mean you should take her to yours. Like I said, we come from a traditional background in which the family’s approval of the man is pretty important, its the time to see if your worthy of their daughter, sister, niece, etc.We run on Mexican time, a stereotype that is actually pretty true…so don’t be surprised if you’re late to functions, gatherings, parties, etc. Simply tell her the set time is an hour before and you should be fine. Trust me she wants to be on time but a lot of times it just doesn’t work out, on the plus side “getting their late” doesn’t really exist on her side of the family, in fact if a party says it starts at 3 it really starts at around 4–6. Now if you’re meeting the family for the first time, “late” does exist so don’t take this concept into consideration, eventually you’ll get the hang of how the timing works and you may even start applying it to your life.Don’t expect her to call you papi, if she does it’s by choice.Don’t ask her to speak Spanish in bed, it can get awkward, if she does and you enjoy it then good, but some may not want to so don’t insist.Her family may be around A LOT. Like I said family is very important to us so don’t be alarmed if it seems like they’re very present. If you despise the idea of this, I would say getting involved with a Mexican girl is probably not the way to go.We are natural caretakers. We’ve been programmed to WANT to take care of those we care for. Whether this means cooking for you, cleaning, being affectionate, or keeping you satisfied in bed. These are all acts of intimacy. BUT like I said we’re going to do it when we WANT to, not simply because you feel entitled to it and expect us to, so if you’re going into a relationship with a Mexican girl because you feel she is domesticated and will have sex whenever you want you need to reevaluate your perception","This really depends on the girl, as well as her background.

However, the ratio may vary slightly depending on the type of rice and personal preference. Check the packaging or use the recommended ratio for the specific type of rice youre cooking. 3. Combine rice and water: In a saucepan, add the rinsed rice and the measured water. You can also add a pinch of salt for flavor if desired. 4. Bring to a boil: Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the rice and water to a boil. 5. Reduce heat and cover: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer. 6. Cook the rice: Allow the rice to cook undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Avoid lifting the lid during this time, as it can interfere with the cooking process. 7. Let it rest: Once the rice is cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This resting period allows the rice to steam and become fully tender. 8. Fluff the rice: After the resting period, use a fork or a rice paddle to gently fluff the rice, separating the grains. This helps prevent clumping and ensures a light, fluffy texture. Remember, cooking times may vary depending on the type and quality of rice, as well as your stoves heat settings. It may take a few attempts to find the perfect cooking time for your preferred rice variety.","ooking rice perfectly involves a few key steps to ensure that the rice comes out fluffy, separate, and not overly sticky.

Mix tuna with herbs, shallot, cornichons, capers and enough mayo to make a nice chunky, interestingly textured spread. Don’t let the tuna flake completely into tiny bits. Season to taste. You do not want everything to be swimming in gallons of mayo. The mayo is the host of the party but it doesn’t want to outshine its guests. You can make this earlier and chill it, covered in film.I like to heat up the baguette a little to make it more crispy. Slice it lengthways.Mix garlic with more mayo until you have aioli, of sorts. It should be nice and garlicky.Spread lower cut surface of baguette with aioli.

A specific niche Before you make your blog, you will also need to figure out what the blog will be about. A niche is an aim at a specific part of the market. You need to think hard about your niche. Nothing stops you from making a blog about everything, but don’t expect to make money out of it in some reasonable time, if ever. If you want to be successful, you need a niche. And you need to stick with it for a long time. So, make sure you will find something you enjoy or something you enjoy researching. The more specific you can get the better. Examples of niches you can write your blog about are:Pet trainingParentingCookingFinancesFitness – focusing on niches like callisthenics, CrossFit, yoga and more are even betterTravel etc.and much more… When you have a niche selected, try to research if there are products you could sell or affiliate programs you could join. You can do so by writing your niche into Google and putting “affiliate” behind it or the word “products”. 4. The unbreakable will The last and most important things you will need are patience, a strong passion and will to continue even when you don’t feel like it. As good as blogging can be, you can never become successful fast. There are people that write 3-5 articles and expect the world to suddenly know who they are. This is unrealistic. If you wish to have this sort of income, you need to be consistent with your efforts. You must understand this is not an overnight success thing. Blogging takes time. This is why I said you will need passion. If you will end up with a niche you chose just for the vision of money, you will eventually dread writing every article. Your blog needs to be something you enjoy most of the time. There will be times when you will hate it, especially at the beginning. You will be writing articles to barely any readers. I promise though, those times will pass. You just need to stick to it. Blogging is a long journey and you need to keep walking to get closer to success. No matter how far it seems. Some other important things you need to know before you start 1.Staying consistent To be successful, you will need to be consistent. This means writing a blog post 2-3 times a week, every single week. You can write more often, but there is a risk of burning out. Weigh out the pros and cons. Faster writing means more content and faster discovery rate. If you create a review blog, it might be also directly tied to the growth of your income. Slower posts mean you can keep up much easier and have more time to research your ideas. Quality over quantity applies in blogging as well. You can also schedule your posts for the future. This means you can prepare posts for a month ahead and then have time to do other things. 2. Research is the key Let’s be honest. No matter how much knowledge you have, you will never have enough information to keep up blogging without research. Research is the key to success. Yes, it turns out success has quite a few locks. You should be in a constant state of learning. Always strive to be better. If you become stagnant, your readers will notice and go elsewhere. Don’t worry though. Research is what you are doing right now. That’s why you are reading this article after all, so you are already going in the right direction. 3. Networking and marketing To speed up your growth, it will be necessary to learn how to network or market your blog. Blogging is about sharing your knowledge, creations or stories with people. As much as this seems like something you will be doing alone, it doesn’t have to be. You can and should ask for help. And, to make money from your efforts, you will also need to learn some marketing strategies to do so. I will go over all these things, so don’t worry. We are in this together.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersIncorrect: Listening to loud music slowly gives me a headache.Correct: When I listen to loud music, I slowly develop a headache.A squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!

Caltech geophysicist Clair Patterson figured out it was 4.5 billion years old. And he used the same technique to get the lead out of the air we breathe. Now the oldest known fossils, in fact, are cyanobacteria from Archaean rocks of western Australia, dated 3.5 billion years old. This may be somewhat surprising, since the oldest rocks are only a little older: 3.8 billion years old! So we know from that the Earth is billions of years old. Now the bible said the world is about 6,000 years old. When we rely on man’s fallible (and often demonstrably false) dating methods, we can get a confusing range of ages from a few thousand to billions of years, though the vast majority of methods do not give dates even close to billions.

For example, if you write “Spearheaded a tournament with a footfall of 10,000 people and generated revenue of Rs. 1 lakh.”, you might want to highlight words like spearheaded, 10,000 people, Rs. 1 Lakh etc. This is because they show the intensity and impact of your work.No work is small work.

So write everything which you think is relevant for the job.There should not be any grammatical mistakes. Double-check, triple-check, ask your friend to review, use online tools like grammarly, do anything but don’t leave any grammatical mistakes in your resume.

It’s a simple equation: 1: Energy coming in Earth constantly receives 342 watts/m2 of energy by the sun. That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less. 2: Energy absorbed Of those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) → higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer → higher temperaturesMore droughts → More forest fires → more co2 → higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%. With the increase of energy absorption of 1.1% by 2.6 watts from 235 to 237.6 watts/m2, we can expect an increase in energy absorption by 3.3%. This is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans. With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes hundreds to thousands of years for newly thawn land to be solid enough to sustain roads, buildings and to become arable for agriculture. 5: What it is not One of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissions stay close to the surface and don’t enter the atmospherere.The only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%). Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2. So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years. That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air? This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:CO2 is a heavy gas, so it sinks in the atmosphere. - Great, that doesn’t change anything.CO2 lags temperature. - Yes, and as explained, it’s not the only cause of climate change (Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation, volcanic, geological activity), but those all remained unchanged while CO2 increased by 40%.Medival Warming Period - This was not a global phenomenon and a tiny temperature change of 0.2 degrees celcius.The temperature records were faked and temperatures in the past were pushed down and pushed up for the recent years so that it appears that the temperature changes were higher. - If you fact check, it turns out this gif just shows the differences for U.S. temperatures vs. global temperatures.Whither U.S. Climate?It was the sun. - No, the sun’s energy sent to earth decreased during the largest temperature increase during the last 200 years while CO2 increased by 40%. This literally only takes 1 minute to fact-check.You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking. This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them. Summary Earth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly. Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space. Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect. This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2. This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean. We can only try to slow down the cascading effect. All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.","here is only one fact that matters. It doesnt matter what 97% of scientists say, what Al Gore says or what NASA says. It’s a simple equation: 1: Energy coming in Earth constantly receives 342 watts/m2 of energy by the sun. That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less. 2: Energy absorbed Of those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2.

It’s a simple equation: 1: Energy coming in Earth constantly receives 342 watts/m2 of energy by the sun. That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less. 2: Energy absorbed Of those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) → higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer → higher temperaturesMore droughts → More forest fires → more co2 → higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%. With the increase of energy absorption of 1.1% by 2.6 watts from 235 to 237.6 watts/m2, we can expect an increase in energy absorption by 3.3%. This is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans. With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes hundreds to thousands of years for newly thawn land to be solid enough to sustain roads, buildings and to become arable for agriculture. 5: What it is not One of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissions stay close to the surface and don’t enter the atmospherere.The only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%). Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2. So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years. That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air?

You will meet more people when you go to more classes, parties, talks and events. You will meet people if you make good eye contact, take initiative and introduce yourself. Dont worry about having an awesome opening line -- if theres an attraction/spark, it wont matter what you say. (Youll have time to redeem  yourself later -- but if you dont say hi, youll never even get the chance to do that, so...)As John Steinbeck once wrote, a great way to meet people is by getting lost. Next time you need directions or a recommendation for a good place to eat, put your stupid smart phone away and ASK a real, live person where to go. I dont have a smart phone, so I have to ask whether I like it or not. And you have no idea how many great friends Ive made this way. Proximity. Its the number one factor in determining liking. So be in proximity with lots of people/women. Apartments, gyms, work, etc. The mere exposure effect states that the more someone sees you, the more they will like you. So see and be seen.Make an effort. Youre shy, so its going to be harder for you to make gestures than maybe it would be for someone else. But if you dont show interest/effort, the girl either wont know youre interested, or wont care. Dont go overboard and scare her, but be sweet and thoughtful and respectful. If you want to see her again, dont push the physical stuff, or she will think youre an asshole. Dont force it. If shes not right for you, shes not right for you. Dont waste your time. You cant change her. Maybe shed make a great friend, though. And if she doesnt like you, theres probably not much you can do (short of making a ton of money or getting a different girl to be your girlfriend) to change her mind. If you text her a lot and she doesnt respond, give her time to write back. Either she will, or she wont. If youre not meeting people in real life, theres nothing terribly wrong or stigmatizing about online dating. Ive never done it, so I cant speak from personal experience.

People, once they have grown up, dont want to be grown-ups; they still want to be kids. They want to have fun and play around, and make tons of mistakes, and not have to suffer for it... It makes people rash, irrational, irresponsible, and potentially easy to fail you if the going gets tough. Granted, this isnt the case for EVERYONE out there; but it does count for a majority population.So... First thing you want to do is IGNORE getting the boyfriend part... Thats the easy part (I dont care what you say, it is the easy part). What you need to do is to determing what a serious relationship is, to you. Being serious requires a lot of maturity; this is off-set by the aforementioned man-children... men-children? Would man-childs plural apply to the man, the child, or both? Hmm... Anyways... Its really hard to find someone mature enough to handle a serious relationship early in their life. It takes experience, and plenty of hardships, to help someone gain enough maturity and/or wisdom to be considered serious. So... Where do you start? I would highly recommend, hold off on the boyfriend until you reach your mid twenties. Yeah, thats a long time for many people... But for most, earlier than that theyll tend to want to focus on partying, or doing the things that only adults can do (clubbing, alcohol, drugs, etc.). This will rear its ugly head when you want help cleaning up after said party first-thing in the morning. So yeah, wait for a bit of time. The older the man, the more experience hes had... Therefore, you have a fairly good chance of finding someone with restraint enough to know when enough is enough.Next... Work. A man with an income is a very beneficial target; even more-so if you, yourself, are working too. Try checking out some of the guys in your workplace, as theyll be the easiest to relate to with regards to the world as a whole. Open up and chat with them, maybe check out some of the stuff they talk about... Who knows, you might like playing Grand Theft Auto: N.Korea. After a little socializing, you could make friends with some of them, and maybe even expand to hanging about with them after work.Finally... Personality. While ugly guys arent necessarily the cream of the crop, some of them can be very respectful people overall. So dont let the physical appearances get to you. Granted, there are some circumstances where it could be deemed... Difficult... To find the guy attractive; but dont give up on him. Perhaps offer assistance, or keep open the friendship barrier with the possibility of future prospects with him? Either way, try and get a guy who has similar interests as you... But is also someone slightly different. The reasons for this would be that people from the other sides of life from you are ones who can both help you to experience, and help protect you from, your weaknesses... In a controlled manner. If you cant swim, for example, having a partner who is a good swimmer can fill you with confidence that being near water wouldnt be too much of a problem if you accidentally fell in. Now do you see why I said to wait?Its painful for many women to wait, especially when they look at their biological clocks. Having to deal with menstruation, the everyday stresses and jealousy that can come from a life without that other half that some people just inherit from existence... You know the ones Im talking about. The first love forever types... Its strange, but it happens.Life throws some really weird curve balls at you... But so long as you take the time to allow both yourself, and your prospective boyfriend, some time to grow before committing... Youll actually be helping BOTH of you out in the long run. And if all of the above sounds like too much hassle and youre primarily looking for the experience of a serious relationship early in life... Just be sure that the guys youre checking out are smart and capable. Enthusiastic, progressive, accepting, etc. So many positive traits that can secure someones position. Just dont rush in; thats the immediate tactic to potential failure. I hope this helps, and good luck finding your White Knight :)","Hi there :) You want a boyfriend... For a serious relationship...

Leverages AI: Underlying all of Grammarly’s products is a sophisticated artificial intelligence system built to analyze sentences written in English. Grammarly’s team of computational linguists and deep learning engineers designs cutting-edge algorithms that learn the rules and hidden patterns of good writing by analyzing millions of sentences from research texts. When you write with Grammarly, our AI analyzes each sentence and looks for ways to improve it, whether it’s correcting a verb tense, suggesting a stronger synonym, or offering a clearer sentence structure. Runs on cloud: As you can imagine, a complex AI system like this one requires a lot of computing power—much more than a personal computer or mobile device can provide. For that reason, it runs in the cloud rather than locally on your device. All you need to check your writing with a Grammarly product is an Internet connection. Improves with data: When you use Grammarly, you can help improve its suggestions. Anytime you hit “ignore” on an unhelpful suggestion, Grammarly gets a little bit smarter. Over time, our team can make adjustments to the suggestions with high ignore rates to make them more helpful. Uses context clues: The difference between Grammarly and built-in spelling and grammar checkers isn’t just accuracy or breadth of feedback, it’s also contextual awareness. After all, an email to your boss probably shouldn’t sound like a text to your best friend. Grammarly’s browser extension, for example, makes stricter grammar corrections and offers suggestions to help you sound more formal and professional when you’re writing on LinkedIn. But when you’re posting on Facebook and you want to write in a more relaxed voice, Grammarly’s casual setting will turn off alerts for the passive voice and informalities like slang and sentence fragments.

In medical terms, it’s known as seborrhea.It is non-contagious and is mainly caused due to factors like:Oily scalpScalp that’s not washed oftenAn yeast-like fungus that feeds on the oil in your scalpExtremely dry skinOr some skin conditions like eczema and psoriasisSo, how do you control your dandruff? Number 1: Make sure your hair and scalp is always squeaky clean Now this is especially for all times that you’re stepping out of the house, exercising, etc. Make sure you dry out your hair properly. Sweating is natural but excessive sweat can again lead to a build up of excess oil and impurities in your scalp and aggravate the problem. Avoid touching your hair and scalp with dirty hands. Number 2: Use the right anti-dandruff shampoo See, there are loads of over the counter anti-dandruff shampoos in the market, but the problem is most of these shampoos tend to dry out your hair too much and make it look lifeless and brittle. This is why it’s important to check with a dermatologist to select the right anti-dandruff shampoo that has the adequate concentration of ingredients to solve the problem without drying out your hair. Number 3: Focus more on healthy eating Your skin and hair condition are heavily linked to your eating habits. Eat foods that are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, protein, and biotin. Eat more greens and at least 1 fruit every single day and you will notice visible progress with your hair and skin in no time. Number 4: Avoid using oil Now this one may seem tricky especially in India, where oiling hair has been one of the oldest and effective ways of hair growth. But unfortunately, when it comes to dandruff, oil can be more of a villain than a friend because it can in turn lead to more dandruff. Oiling hair forms a layer in the scalp, restricting the natural entry of moisture. This can result in blocked hair follicles, which can further cause dandruff. Number 5: Maintain good hygiene Always make sure your pillow cases are washed and changed regularly and your hair brushes and combs are clean. Avoid sharing these objects with anyone else, to maintain the best hair hygiene. Number 6: Try the hot towel technique You can try this while applying any anti-dandruff lotions or masks on your hair. Take a big towel, long enough to cover your entire head. Submerge it in hot water for a few seconds, wring out the excess water, then wrap it around your head like a turban. This hot towel therapy will open the blocked pores in your scalp, letting the nutrients from the products you’re using for dandruff, penetrate well. Make sure to do this only once or twice a month, because overdoing it may result in dry hair. Lastly, do check with a dermatologist before using any home remedies like tea tree oil, lemon/curd masks, etc. for dandruff, because sometimes these can have contraindications, and cause more harm than good.","o, first of all, dandruff is nothing but white flaky skin that often clouds your scalp and sometimes, also your skin.

The only way you can mess this up is by leaving it in the oven too long. So take your seasoned salmon fillet and place it in a pan layered with some oil and lined with some onion slices so the salmon doesnt stick to the pan (or you could line the pan with something like asparagus if you want to cook some veggies at the same time). Pre-heat your oven as high as it will go, and place the pan in the oven and let the fish bake for about 7 to 10 minutes (depending on the thickness of the fillet and the heat of your oven). When its done the fish should feel like a medium rare filet mignon to the touch. Let the salmon rest for at least 7 minutes before you cut into it. After resting, your salmon will absorb all its moisture, and it will just flake off in thin pieces with the slightest touch of a fork. Now Im not saying there aren’t other great ways of cooking salmon, such as grilling on a cedar plank, or pan frying skin-down etc, but when you dont cook it on high heat, people often either dry it out, or at the other extreme cook it in a way that it has a mushy texture. The method I mention however is not only the easiest, but it will yield succulent, moist and flaky salmon every time.","ne of the best cooking tips I ever learned while working five years in an upscale seafood restaurant is this: always cook fish on high heat.

The only way you can mess this up is by leaving it in the oven too long. So take your seasoned salmon fillet and place it in a pan layered with some oil and lined with some onion slices so the salmon doesnt stick to the pan (or you could line the pan with something like asparagus if you want to cook some veggies at the same time). Pre-heat your oven as high as it will go, and place the pan in the oven and let the fish bake for about 7 to 10 minutes (depending on the thickness of the fillet and the heat of your oven). When its done the fish should feel like a medium rare filet mignon to the touch. Let the salmon rest for at least 7 minutes before you cut into it. After resting, your salmon will absorb all its moisture, and it will just flake off in thin pieces with the slightest touch of a fork. Now Im not saying there aren’t other great ways of cooking salmon, such as grilling on a cedar plank, or pan frying skin-down etc, but when you dont cook it on high heat, people often either dry it out, or at the other extreme cook it in a way that it has a mushy texture. The method I mention however is not only the easiest, but it will yield succulent, moist and flaky salmon every time. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

You can partially cook it, drain it and assemble it from that point, or you can use it dry and assemble it in that manner. Both work equally well, with the dry version of boxed pasta working a bit better than partially cooked boxed pasta. We prefer homemade, fresh pasta. Select the meat and cheese you want in your lasagne. We use a spicy hot Italian sausage, and a grass fed ground beef. For cheese we use homemade ricotta, and a good quality mozzarella. Sometimes, but not always we make our own of that, too. We also use freshly grated parmigiano reggiano. Put some sauce in the bottom of the pan, and then put in one layer of pasta. Add the meat scattered evenly over the pasta. Drop by spoonfuls, the ricotta to which you have added a beaten egg and seasoned it with garlic, oregano, parsley, and a little thyme. Add the mozzarella cheese next, again in an even layer. Use a light hand with cheese. Too much will ruin the dish. Finish with sauce. Continue layering in this manner until you reach the top of your pan. End with a sauce layer, and top with mozzarella and the last of the freshly grated parmigiano reggiano. The proportions will be driven by the number of people you are going to feed. Also, the proportions will be governed by your personal preference. Some folks like it very meaty, and saucy, others like it heavier on cheese. We like the condimento philosophy of not over using any one ingredient.  There are as many versions of lasagne as there are Italian grandmothers, so keep that in mind. Some use a bechamel sauce as one of the layers. Some do not use hamburger at all.

Dice the bell peppers, the courgettes, and the aubergine. Slice the onion and mince the garlic. Heat a large pan, add a few tablespoons of extravirgin olive oil, then add the onion. When the onion is softened, add the garlic, then after a few minutes add the diced vegetables. Add a large pinch of salt and cook until the vegetables start to soften. Now add the tomatoes (eyeball the amount, the result should be reddish but not too saucy). Around 10 minutes before the sauce is ready, add the peas. Check salt and pepper when it’s almost ready. Meanwhile prepare the bechamel sauce. In a suitable pan or pot, melt 100 grams of butter, then add the flour and stir until it starts to turn light gold. Add now the milk stirring vigorously with a whisk. When there are no lumps, add salt, a good amount of freshly grated nutmeg, and simmer stirring until the sauce coats the back of the spoon. Stir in around 75 grams of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, stir until it’s melted, and cover with a lid to prevent the sauce from forming a skin. Also, start a large pot of water boiling, and salt heavily. Parboil the pasta sheets for a minute. I like to do it as I layer the lasagne in the baking tray. For layering, start using some of the leftover butter to butter the tray. Place a thin layer of bechamel on the bottom, then start layering the lasagne, topping them with some of the vegetables and the bechamel, plus a light dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano. Continue until running out of ingredients, and complete the last layer of vegetables and top with the rest of the bechamel, a heavier dusting of cheese, and a few knobs of butter. Bake at 180*C for around 35–40 minutes, then turn off the oven and grill for 5–10 minutes. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing.","ust one lasagna?

It’s a genius solution to a problem none of us even realized we were experiencing. And why art? Contemporary art prices have outperformed the S&amp;P by 174% between 1995 and 2020. That might be why Ivy League endowments have allocated 10x more into alternatives like art since 2000.

Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objectives as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don’t need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.Lead with your strengths. Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective.

Drying and resting will improve your pasta.Do not overcook your pasta! Fresh pasta dropped into boiling water will be done in just a minute or two.If you are using the pasta in soup, I recommend cooking it separately, then adding it to the soup right when it is being served.

Slowly using the fork to add in more and more flour( did I mention slowly?) until the mixture starts to form into a ball. I then dump the contents onto a pre floured surface. After all that you should have a gelatinous mass of flour and egg and this just will not do!! So at this point you start kneeding the ball gently, only adding as much force as is necessary to press the mass together, turning the dough a quarter of a turn after each press. Kneading is when you use the palm of your hand(or heel of your palm ) to press down on the dough while sort of rolling it. You may have some dry bits make sure to toss those out as they are no bueno. Continue the kneading until your dough is springy. If you press your thumb into the dough the indention should basically fix itself. Once at this point cover your dough and let it rest while you prepare the water, sauce and other what nots. Then cut the mass into halfs or quarters for a more manageable piece of dough. From here you work it out with whatever equipment you wish to use.

You will not grow taller through exercise alone.If you are unhappy with your height even after your teenage years, you need determination and focus to grow taller. Exercises will strengthen your muscles and release the growth hormones, and diet will keep these hormones fresh and active. Stretches for Gaining HeightYouve probably done stretches before; theyre the most effective warm-up for any type of workout. I recommended that you do the stretches for at least fifteen minutes everyday. Some good stretches for lengthening the spine and improving posture include:Cat and cow - Start in a tabletop position on your hands and knees. Breathe in and arch your back, lifting your hips and head. When you breathe out, round your back, lowering your head and drawing your pelvis toward the front. Repeat, moving with your breath.Bridge - Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground, with your heels near your buttocks. Leave your arms straight down by your sides. Press your feet into the ground and lift your hips and buttocks, and stay in that position for a few deep breaths. Lower your back very slowly, one vertebrae at a time, from the nape of your neck to your lower spine.Cobra - Lie on your stomach with your palms flat on the ground under the tops of your shoulders. Press into the ground and lift your chest and head, arching your backTable top - Sit on the ground with your knees bent, and your feet flat on the ground in front of you. Place your hands on the ground behind you, with your fingertips facing forward. Press your hands and feet into the ground, lifting your hips and chest straight up. If comfortable for your neck, lower your head to look behind you, stretching out the front of your neck and chest. Your body should look like a table top.Forward fold - Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart. Bend forward at your hips, bending your knees if necessary. Bending your knees if your hamstrings are tight will release your lower back, elongating your spine. Alternatively, you can sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you and fold forward.Twists - There are many types of twists you can do to lengthen your body. The most simple is to lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Grab your left knee with your right hand and pull both of your knees to the right. Do the same with the right knee, twisting to the left. You can also lie flat on your back with your legs outstretched. Hug your right knee into your chest, and twist it across your body to the left using your left hand. Draw your right arm to the right and turn your head to the right, fully twisting your spine. Repeat in the opposite direction.Hanging exercises - Hanging exercises can be done by almost anyone, but youd be surprised at how physically challenging it is to simply hang from a pull-up bar. At first it might be tough but with time you will be able to hang for long periods of time. Simply hanging on a bar with your arms and spine stretching for just ten seconds at a time will give you amazing results.

Exercises will strengthen your muscles and release the growth hormones, and diet will keep these hormones fresh and active. Stretches for Gaining HeightYouve probably done stretches before; theyre the most effective warm-up for any type of workout. I recommended that you do the stretches for at least fifteen minutes everyday. Some good stretches for lengthening the spine and improving posture include:Cat and cow - Start in a tabletop position on your hands and knees. Breathe in and arch your back, lifting your hips and head. When you breathe out, round your back, lowering your head and drawing your pelvis toward the front. Repeat, moving with your breath.Bridge - Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground, with your heels near your buttocks. Leave your arms straight down by your sides. Press your feet into the ground and lift your hips and buttocks, and stay in that position for a few deep breaths. Lower your back very slowly, one vertebrae at a time, from the nape of your neck to your lower spine.Cobra - Lie on your stomach with your palms flat on the ground under the tops of your shoulders. Press into the ground and lift your chest and head, arching your backTable top - Sit on the ground with your knees bent, and your feet flat on the ground in front of you. Place your hands on the ground behind you, with your fingertips facing forward. Press your hands and feet into the ground, lifting your hips and chest straight up. If comfortable for your neck, lower your head to look behind you, stretching out the front of your neck and chest. Your body should look like a table top.Forward fold - Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart. Bend forward at your hips, bending your knees if necessary. Bending your knees if your hamstrings are tight will release your lower back, elongating your spine. Alternatively, you can sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you and fold forward.Twists - There are many types of twists you can do to lengthen your body. The most simple is to lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Grab your left knee with your right hand and pull both of your knees to the right. Do the same with the right knee, twisting to the left. You can also lie flat on your back with your legs outstretched. Hug your right knee into your chest, and twist it across your body to the left using your left hand. Draw your right arm to the right and turn your head to the right, fully twisting your spine. Repeat in the opposite direction.Hanging exercises - Hanging exercises can be done by almost anyone, but youd be surprised at how physically challenging it is to simply hang from a pull-up bar. At first it might be tough but with time you will be able to hang for long periods of time. Simply hanging on a bar with your arms and spine stretching for just ten seconds at a time will give you amazing results. Do this for two minutes every day (ten seconds for twelve repetitions) and youll see what magic it can do.Swimming - If you dont know how to swim, you should learn if you want to be taller. Swimming for at least five hours a week will start doing wonders for your height. Swimming is a whole-body exercise made more intense by water resistance. When you use your body, legs, and arms to the fullest, theyre going to develop muscle strength, which will lengthen your limbs within weeks.All these work no matter how old you are, and many people have started seeing positive results within a few days.Dont go for surgery or pills because it is important to increase height naturally. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy.

The poster above says that the numbers for imperial measurements are ‘pseudo-random’ and that’s utterly incorrect. The numbers may seem random if you’ve grown up in a totally decimal world but the absolutely aren’t. They are older systems but that doesn’t mean the people who came up with them just plucked the numbers out of the air. The figures were logically thought out, it’s only because you’ve grown up with base 10 that you can’t see the benefits to base 12. So - Why 5280 feet exactly? Because, like most of the common imperial measurements it divides neatly into many common divisors. That’s how they were designed to work and that’s how the numbers were arrived at. 5280 divides exactly by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12. That means that as someone with no calculator and only basic knowledge of mathematics you can easily calculate half a mile, or a third, or a fifth or a twelfth. If you think about it for longer than two minutes then this is a vast benefit. Whole numbers of yards (or inches or minutes; yes our time uses this system too) are much much easier to think in than long strings of decimal places. How far is a third of a kilometer? 333.333333333333m. If you need to mark out that exact distance that’s really quite hard to do. But how far is a third of a mile? 1760 feet exactly. It’s the same on the small scale; a third of a foot is 4 inches, a third of a meter is 33.333cm. Also, because these figures are whole number you can add together weird combinations quite easily. What is a third of a mile plus an eighth of a mile? 1760 + 660 = 2420 feet. It’s hard to get across just how valuable this capability is to people who’ve been fairly well educated and brought out to think that decimal measurements are just ‘correct’ and obviously so easy to work with. The imperial system is designed for people with minimal schooling and who have to think about day to day physical objects in the real world that are not easily divisible into very small fractions. We work vastly better thinking in whole numbers and we can handle much more complex mathematics when we are working from simple whole numbers. The overall argument, in truth, is the argument of decimal (base 10) vs duodecimal (base 12). While most of us feel like decimal is just the obvious and natural choice in truth it’s completely arbitrary. It makes no difference really, it’s simply a matter of preference. Base 12 is much easier for normal people handling small numbers but is far less ideal for anyone working in very large numbers. In science where we are talking about huge numbers or tiny numbers decimal helps us in thinking about things because something like [math]8*10^9[/math] gives a round number where in base 12 it doesn’t. That’s why we changed to decimal stuff for many things, and why scientists in the US use meters and kilograms. Now that most people are more educated and learn about exponents and algebra at school it’s much less of a big deal for things to be easily divisible. We also have much more accurate measuring and weighing equipment capable of diving physical objects into very accurate amounts; it’s machines cutting our cloth and steel and most things really. It’s not that big a deal now, and when you teach kids to think in base 10 then they handle it fine. But I think it’s important to note that other places in the world do still work in base 12 and teach their kids that way. You can even count on your fingers in base 12 (you count on the segments on your fingers)! Notably we still use base 12 time because it’s something that everyone uses every day and those simple divisors help a lot. It’s so very helpful for a quarter of an hour to be a whole number of minutes, for example. It’s hugely important to never assume that things created in the past must be bad simply because we don’t use them anymore. Just like today, those who were formulating standard units thought hard about how that system was going to be used. The imperial system suffers from some ‘design by committee’ problems where many parts of the system work in different ways because it was the culmination of lots of less formal systems being slowly standardized over a long period, and that’s where much of the confusion comes from. Some work on 12 some on 14 or 16 some on 24. There’s lots of weird and seldom used units too like chains and furlongs that really aren’t integral to the system but that get dredged up to illustrate how silly it all is. What is a ‘quarter’? It’s 28 pounds. Why? Because that is a quarter of a hundredweight. Obviously. Don’t presume that imperial units are stupid just because you weren’t brought up to use them. There’s reasons for them and while maybe we’ve grown past the point where those reasons are all that big of a deal to us they served their purpose well for a long time. The fact that you can build battleships and fighter planes (as Britain and the US did) off the imperial system illustrates that these systems are just as accurate and effective. They are much less suited to a computerized, technologically focused world but they aren’t random or wrong; just made for a different time.","760 yards is a mile because there are 3 feet in a yard and 5280 is the important figure here.

The figures were logically thought out, it’s only because you’ve grown up with base 10 that you can’t see the benefits to base 12. So - Why 5280 feet exactly? Because, like most of the common imperial measurements it divides neatly into many common divisors. That’s how they were designed to work and that’s how the numbers were arrived at. 5280 divides exactly by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12. That means that as someone with no calculator and only basic knowledge of mathematics you can easily calculate half a mile, or a third, or a fifth or a twelfth. If you think about it for longer than two minutes then this is a vast benefit. Whole numbers of yards (or inches or minutes; yes our time uses this system too) are much much easier to think in than long strings of decimal places. How far is a third of a kilometer? 333.333333333333m. If you need to mark out that exact distance that’s really quite hard to do. But how far is a third of a mile? 1760 feet exactly. It’s the same on the small scale; a third of a foot is 4 inches, a third of a meter is 33.333cm. Also, because these figures are whole number you can add together weird combinations quite easily. What is a third of a mile plus an eighth of a mile? 1760 + 660 = 2420 feet.

One-litre beer mugs ( German : Maßkrüge ) at the 2006 Oktoberfest in Germany The litre (international spelling) or liter ( American English spelling) (SI symbols L and l , [1] other symbol used: ℓ ) is a metric unit of volume . It is equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm 3 ), 1000 cubic centimetres (cm 3 ) or 0.001 cubic metre (m 3 ). A cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of 10 cm × 10&nbsp;cm × 10&nbsp;cm (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre. The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit . The word litre is derived from an older French unit, the litron , whose name came from Byzantine Greek —where it was a unit of weight, not volume [2] —via Late Medieval Latin, and which equalled approximately 0.831&nbsp;litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI, [3] although not an SI unit —the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre (m 3 ). The spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures is litre, [3] a spelling which is shared by most English-speaking countries. The spelling liter is predominantly used in American English . [a] One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram , because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ( 0&nbsp;°C ). [4] Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact. [5] Definition [ edit ] Some SI units of volume to scale and approximate corresponding mass of water A litre is a cubic decimetre , which is the volume of a cube 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres (1&nbsp;L ≡ 1&nbsp;dm 3 ≡ 1000&nbsp;cm 3 ). Hence 1&nbsp;L ≡ 0.001 m 3 ≡ 1000 cm 3 ; and 1&nbsp;m 3 (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the SI unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L. From 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+3.98&nbsp;°C) [ citation needed ] and standard pressure . The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000 028 dm 3 . Additionally, the mass–volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the CGPM (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.

[4] Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact. [5] Definition [ edit ] Some SI units of volume to scale and approximate corresponding mass of water A litre is a cubic decimetre , which is the volume of a cube 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres (1&nbsp;L ≡ 1&nbsp;dm 3 ≡ 1000&nbsp;cm 3 ). Hence 1&nbsp;L ≡ 0.001 m 3 ≡ 1000 cm 3 ; and 1&nbsp;m 3 (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the SI unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L. From 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+3.98&nbsp;°C) [ citation needed ] and standard pressure . The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000 028 dm 3 . Additionally, the mass–volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the CGPM (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols. A litre is equal in volume to the millistere , an obsolete non-SI metric unit formerly customarily used fhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre Milli- Definition &amp; Meaning - Dictionary.comMilli- definition, a combining form meaning “thousand” (millipede): in the metric system, used in the names of units equal to one thousandth of the given base unit (millimeter).

From a stat point of view the argument gets even worse. LeBron averages more points per game than Kobe (both regular season and playoffs) and does it more efficiently (missing fewer shots). LeBron is also a better passer, rebounder and defender, so that makes Kobe’s argument pretty weak. But how about their performance in the Finals? Surely, as Kobe is super-clutch, that’s where his dominance will be asserted. Here are some Finals per-game averages Player A: 25.2 points on 24.7 shooting possessions, 5.6 rebounds, 5.1 assistsPlayer B: 28.3 points on 25.7 shooting possessions, 9.8 rebounds, 7.7 assists Pretty obvious who is whom, right? Player B destroys player A on boards and assists, and scores 3.1 points per game more while using only one more shot to do it. Not much of an argument, right? About about individual Finals performances? Let’s consider probably Kobe’s best Finals, the 09 series against the Magic where he averaged 32.4 points (on 30.9 shots), 5.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists. Pretty great right? Compare that with LeBron’s 2012 performance against Oklahoma City, where LeBron averaged 28.6 points (on 25.6 shots) plus 10.2 boards and 7.4 assists. Kind of comparable right? Kobe scored more (though less efficiently) and LeBron averaged almost five more boards per game. I could see a Kobe fan considering the Kobe series as the superior series. What if I told you that the listed LeBron stat line was probably only his fifth best Finals? How about 2015 against the Warriors when he averaged 35.8 (on 37.6 shots), with 13.3 boards and 8.8 assists. Yeah, it was inefficient, but it’s still more than Kobe’s ever scored per game in the Finals. How about 2016 against the Warriors when he averaged 29.7 points (on 26.4 shots) with 11.3 boards and 8.9 assists (and 4.9 steals+blocks)? How about the 2018 Finals against the Warriors when he averaged 34 points (on 27.4 shots - holy heck) with 8.5 boards and 10 assists? How about the 2017 Finals against the Warriors when he averaged 33.6 points (on 26.7 shots) with 12 boards and 10 assists? I’m sorry, Kobe’s best Finals performance simply can’t compete with those. Not even close. But LeBron is a choker, right? What about his 2007 Finals against the Spurs (22 points on 17.6 shots, 7 boards and 6.8 assists). What about his 2011 performance against the Mavericks (17.8 points per game on 18.8 shots, 7.2 boards and 6.8 assists). Neither of those are very impressive lines. But let’s compare with Kobe’s worst two, his 2000 against the Pacers (15.6 points per game on 19 shots, 4.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists) and his 2004 against the Pistons (22.6 points per game on 24.8 shots, 2.8 rebounds and 4.4 assists). I don’t know how you can look at those stat lines and think anything other than that LeBron is the better scorer in the Finals (both more points and more efficient) and clearly the better rebounder and passer. What about Game 7s? Looking at the last five for each player: Points per game: LeBron 34.4, Kobe 21.6FG%: LeBron 49.1%, Kobe 37.2%+/-: LeBron +44, Kobe +1 Not close. What about buzzer beaters, say, game-tying or go-ahead shots in the final ten seconds of playoff games? LeBron is 6 of 14 on those shots (43%).Kobe is 5 of 22 on those shots (23%). Not an advantage for Kobe there. But let’s say that you’re not convinced. Let’s say that you still think that Kobe does more than LeBron, but in a way that isn’t covered by points, shots, rebounds and assists. How about looking at +/-? Plus-minus just compares how good a team is when a player is on the court compared with when they’re off the court. It’s an imperfect but quick and dirty glance at player value in a more subtle way than the box score stats. Kobe’s Plus-Minus numbers? Only looking at his performance through age 34 (which is good because his last three years are awful), Kobe’s teams are +5.3 (5.3 points above average per game) when he’s on the court and -1.5 when he’s off the court, for a combined plus-minus of +6.8. His best year by this stat was 2009–10 when he put up a +12.4 for the season. Further, he had four different +10 or better seasons (02–03, 05–06, 08–09 and 09–10). Compare this with LeBron (only through age 34). LeBron’s teams have been +7.0 when he’s on the court and -4.4 when he’s off the court, for a total of +11.4 overall. His best season by this measure is 08–09 when he put up a +21.2 (not a misprint; they outscored opponents by 15 points when he was playing, and were outscored by 6.2 when he was sitting). LeBron has nine different seasons above 10 and six above 15. Not a close comparison. LeBron’s teams played better with him than Kobe’s did, but were worse without him. Huge gap.

Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself. For an extra pair of editing eyes on everything you write, download the free Grammarly for Windows and Mac today. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food. They didn’t need to lower everything! Step Away From The Carbs: The science behind weight loss, the recipes to make it happen.

This illustrates how ridiculous ‘‘calories in vs calories out’ is It’s also to highlight that calorie deficit is meaningless. So using a macronutrient mix is important, not calories. So two more examplesYou eat a mix of healthy high fats, moderate protein and low refined carbohydrates.Your twin eats bread, pasta, rice, crackers, potatoes, breakfast cereal, low-fat yoghurt, low or no sugar sodas, baked beans, avoids fats, has skimmed milk and tons of fruit.Result You will be lean but sadly your twin has a 1–3 chance of either type 2 diabetes, obesity or heart disease.

You can get it in 5,000 IU capsules. Then, once the crises is over, take 5,000 IU a day and never have another cold or flu. BTW, the number one symptom of vitamin D deficiency is a cold or flu. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )
