A lot of people telling you to avoid sugar but not carbohydrates? Sugar is a carbohydrate. So just look at what type of food you eat and cut out refined carbohydrates, sugar and fructose and you will lose weight. No cardio, no running, no exercise. It’s ALL ABOUT YOUR BODYS FAT STORING REGULATION. How the body stores or burns fat. This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food. They didn’t need to lower everything! Step Away From The Carbs: The science behind weight loss, the recipes to make it happen.

Everyone’s basic metabolic rate can change by as much 40% on a daily basis so: Eat when your hungry. WEIGHTLOSS: It’s all about what you eat. I’ll use a silly example, let’s sayyou eat 1500 calories from salad andyour identical twin ate 1500 calories from chocolate chip cookies.Do you think you’d get the same outcome? This illustrates how ridiculous ‘‘calories in vs calories out’ is It’s also to highlight that calorie deficit is meaningless. So using a macronutrient mix is important, not calories. So two more examplesYou eat a mix of healthy high fats, moderate protein and low refined carbohydrates.Your twin eats bread, pasta, rice, crackers, potatoes, breakfast cereal, low-fat yoghurt, low or no sugar sodas, baked beans, avoids fats, has skimmed milk and tons of fruit.Result You will be lean but sadly your twin has a 1–3 chance of either type 2 diabetes, obesity or heart disease. If you doubt this please think about the global rise in the consumption of your twins nutrition choices and the global rise in those conditions. In the year 2000 the rise in ‘low-fat’ things took over. So although carbs dropped off sugar and fructose keep people getting fatter, along with those carbs! Remember there are tons of different names for sugar!It’s all down to insulin resistance. Insulin is your fat storing hormone. Keep it low and you won’t get fat. Even eating too much protein gets insulin working in the blood.

I ate a lot at that time and still feel hungry. Though my mother always cooked healthy food for us, I loved to have all kinds of junk and oily food on daily basis.

I suddenly gained weight due to thyroid and cyst in my ovary. I used to sleep 11hrs in a day and still feel sleepy the whole day. I ate a lot at that time and still feel hungry. Though my mother always cooked healthy food for us, I loved to have all kinds of junk and oily food on daily basis. My mental and physical condition deteriorated a lot during that time. I was practically turning bald and my face covered with acne! My school friends made fun of me in every situation and my teachers disliked me for my lack of concentration and laziness in class. Yuucckkk!!! (I still shiver remembering those days!) Things turned so bad that one day I pledged to reduce my weight and remove all these negative things out of my life! I didn’t join the gym as I heard from somewhere that when I leave the gym, I would again gain weight as before.So, first I took control of all the junk, spicy food that i used to have. From street food to golguppe to biryani, I left all. I didn’t even have any aerated drinks, chips, french fries, burgers, sweets(including sugar), chocolates and what not! I craved for them but somehow I managed to divert my mind and explain the adversity of having them.Next, I downloaded some youtube videos of exercises on losing weight. These videos were mainly Zumba dances and exercises which consists more of dance and less of strenuous exercises (I love dancing! ;)) I can recall the videos were of PowerGirls Workout videos. Do check them out!Walk and walk and walk a lot! I used to attend my coaching classes in the evening which were 20mins by auto/rickshaw. I used to walk the whole route and even return on foot which took me 50mins in the whole journey. You should atleast walk 3-4kms everyday to stay fit.Have lots of fruits and drink plenty of water daily. I only used to have home cooked food made by my mother and every other food was restricted for me.Sleep well and most importantly avoid STRESS!! Frustration, anxiety and stress can drastically change your inner balance with body.Within 2–3months , I started seeing change in my body. I started losing weight(my friends were in awe!) and things gradually turned normal. After 7–8months, every single person I know couldn’t recognize me as they never thought I could bring such a change in myself. I lost around 12–13kgs and had a nice body(my friends were jealous of me :P) by then. So, the main part is you don’t need to follow crash diet or work-out 4hrs a day to reduce your tummy only to get it back within a few months! Do it in a healthy way, have patience, believe in yourself and you will definitely get the results. Good Luck! :) Hope this helps..

Though my mother always cooked healthy food for us, I loved to have all kinds of junk and oily food on daily basis. My mental and physical condition deteriorated a lot during that time. I was practically turning bald and my face covered with acne! My school friends made fun of me in every situation and my teachers disliked me for my lack of concentration and laziness in class. Yuucckkk!!! (I still shiver remembering those days!) Things turned so bad that one day I pledged to reduce my weight and remove all these negative things out of my life! I didn’t join the gym as I heard from somewhere that when I leave the gym, I would again gain weight as before.So, first I took control of all the junk, spicy food that i used to have. From street food to golguppe to biryani, I left all. I didn’t even have any aerated drinks, chips, french fries, burgers, sweets(including sugar), chocolates and what not! I craved for them but somehow I managed to divert my mind and explain the adversity of having them.Next, I downloaded some youtube videos of exercises on losing weight. These videos were mainly Zumba dances and exercises which consists more of dance and less of strenuous exercises (I love dancing! ;)) I can recall the videos were of PowerGirls Workout videos. Do check them out!Walk and walk and walk a lot! I used to attend my coaching classes in the evening which were 20mins by auto/rickshaw. I used to walk the whole route and even return on foot which took me 50mins in the whole journey. You should atleast walk 3-4kms everyday to stay fit.Have lots of fruits and drink plenty of water daily. I only used to have home cooked food made by my mother and every other food was restricted for me.Sleep well and most importantly avoid STRESS!! Frustration, anxiety and stress can drastically change your inner balance with body.Within 2–3months , I started seeing change in my body. I started losing weight(my friends were in awe!) and things gradually turned normal. After 7–8months, every single person I know couldn’t recognize me as they never thought I could bring such a change in myself. I lost around 12–13kgs and had a nice body(my friends were jealous of me :P) by then. So, the main part is you don’t need to follow crash diet or work-out 4hrs a day to reduce your tummy only to get it back within a few months! Do it in a healthy way, have patience, believe in yourself and you will definitely get the results. Good Luck! :) Hope this helps..

About how much goes into a small medicine cup. It is about 30 milliliters in metric volume (more precisely 29.5735297 milliliters) 8 fluid ounces = 1 Cup The Imperial Gallon (UK): The imperial gallon (UK) is a unit for estimating a volume of liquid or the size of a container for collecting liquid, not the mass of a liquid. Thus, a gallon of one of the liquid may have a separate mass from a gallon of another liquid. An imperial gallon of liquid is described as 4.54609 liters and thus keeps a space similar to almost 4,546 cubic centimeters (approximately a 16.5 cm cube). The U.S liquid gallon and the U.S. dry gallon are separate units determined by various medians. The U.S. liquid gallon is described as 231 cubic inches and equalizes to around 3.785 liters. One imperial gallon is equal to almost 1.2 U.S. liquid gallons. The U.S. dry gallon is a determination historically referred to as a volume of grain or other dry items. No longer regularly used, but most recently described as 268.8025 cubic inches. It depends on the system that you are working in. The most popular are the UK Imperial system and the which is a modification of the Imperial system. These were apparently the most popular due to the population, power, and influence of the UK and the US.

About how much goes into a small medicine cup. It is about 30 milliliters in metric volume (more precisely 29.5735297 milliliters) 8 fluid ounces = 1 Cup The Imperial Gallon (UK): The imperial gallon (UK) is a unit for estimating a volume of liquid or the size of a container for collecting liquid, not the mass of a liquid. Thus, a gallon of one of the liquid may have a separate mass from a gallon of another liquid. An imperial gallon of liquid is described as 4.54609 liters and thus keeps a space similar to almost 4,546 cubic centimeters (approximately a 16.5 cm cube). The U.S liquid gallon and the U.S. dry gallon are separate units determined by various medians. The U.S. liquid gallon is described as 231 cubic inches and equalizes to around 3.785 liters. One imperial gallon is equal to almost 1.2 U.S. liquid gallons. The U.S. dry gallon is a determination historically referred to as a volume of grain or other dry items. No longer regularly used, but most recently described as 268.8025 cubic inches. It depends on the system that you are working in. The most popular are the UK Imperial system and the which is a modification of the Imperial system.

The ending of the preliminary 9 weeks denotes the midterm of the fall semester, while the end of the third 9 weeks denotes the midterm of the spring semester.  Midterm exams are given in secondary school, and the spring midterm ordinarily denotes the start of a week-long Spring Break. Its more common to have a short break after the fall midterm, yet this normally just 1-3 days long rather than a whole week.

A lot of the politicians support Trump, while the people don’t support either candidate (in the primaries they supported Sanders). In the political arena in Tehran, both hardliners and moderates support Trump, which might be confusing given Trump’s continuous bashing of the Iran nuclear deal, but their train of thought basically goes like this: For hardliners in Iran, they see the Nuclear deal as bad for Iran. While Trump sees the deal as bad for the US, they both have a common goal of getting rid of this deal and either replacing it with a better one, or going back to hostile relations. These hardliners do view Trump as a crazy person, but simply believe that Iran is giving too many concessions, and want a new deal, and they know that if a Democrat wins, they are not getting that new deal. Iran’s hard-liners want a better nuclear deal, too For moderates it’s a little less obvious but as they see it, most of the countries in the world hate Trump and would want nothing to do with him or his administration if he gets elected, which gives a better outlook for Iran and its economy in their eyes. It’s currently been almost 8 months since the sanctions were lifted from Iran’s economy, in accordance to the Nuclear Deal, and yet neither the economy nor anyone in Iran can really feel a difference. This is because sanctions on Iran were initially imposed by broad range of countries around the world, and while these non-US sanctions have been eased, they are still subject to come back if even one of these countries slightly suspects Iran of violating the deal. This has caused most of the world’s banks and businesses to stay clear of Iran’s economy, since they are afraid of these sanctions suddenly coming back. This is where Trump comes in. Since Trump alienates nearly every country on the Earth in his nationalistic view (fraying relationships with many countries), the countries in this sanctions coalition (US, EU, Japan, China, Russia) might decide that remaining in this coalition is not worth losing out on a potentially profitable Iranian economy. And if Trump decides to, “rip up the nuclear deal,” as he says, without the approval of these other countries, then this would leave the US isolated from all these other countries, leaving Iran to cultivate better ties with all of them. Another plus for these politicians is Trump’s approach on Saudi Arabia. Iranians see Saudi Arabia’s influence in Washington as the cause for many of their problems with the US. But Trump promises to “remove the cloak of American protection” from Saudi Arabia and wants to stop American oil purchases from the kingdom (essentially cutting ties). This sounds amazing to Iranian politicians. Now for the Iranian people, they see Trump as a crazy person, as the rest of the world does, given his comments on Iran, the nuclear deal, and Muslims. However, they also know Clinton as the “sanctions lady.” Given that during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, she was very “anti-Iran” and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran in 2010, along with the rest of the sanctions coalition. Iranians worry that a President Clinton may bring in a wave of secondary sanctions given Iran’s activities in the region. They also see Clinton as very pro-Israel and pro-KSA, which would be, well anti-Iran. Frankly, the people would not want either Trump or Clinton in office, which is a conundrum many Americans find themselves in as well.","n Iran the situation is quite different from most other countries.

This sounds amazing to Iranian politicians. Now for the Iranian people, they see Trump as a crazy person, as the rest of the world does, given his comments on Iran, the nuclear deal, and Muslims. However, they also know Clinton as the “sanctions lady.” Given that during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, she was very “anti-Iran” and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran in 2010, along with the rest of the sanctions coalition. Iranians worry that a President Clinton may bring in a wave of secondary sanctions given Iran’s activities in the region. They also see Clinton as very pro-Israel and pro-KSA, which would be, well anti-Iran. Frankly, the people would not want either Trump or Clinton in office, which is a conundrum many Americans find themselves in as well. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Bill Shorten, the leader of the Australian Labor Party (the centre left party in Australian politics) has described Donald Trump’s views as “barking mad”.

So there is always the quick easy no special ingredients, no special prep recipe in my head for just whipping up a batch. You start with two bowls, a wet and a dry bowl. Set up your griddle, you want it nice and hot, 375°F.In the wet bowl, you can beat an egg with a whisk, add a cup of milk, 2 Tablespoons of oil, and a teaspoon of vanilla.

Pro tip: Now is the time to do anything else you want to do before youre ready to cook. You want to wait to blend the wet and dry ingredients until a few minutes before youre ready to cook. Ready? Pour the wet on top of the dry, and with a stiff spatula, fold together until they are slightly lumpy: you dont want the batter completely smooth.OK. Now you have a decision to make. Easy and slightly less attractive pancakes or a bit of a pain and really pretty pancakes? Easy? Put some oil or butter down on the griddle. Pretty? Put the batter on the sort of non-stick griddle dry, and spray your stainless steel spatula with non stick spray, for when youre ready to carefully turn them. Using a 1/4 - 1/3 cup size ladle (I actually prefer using 2 scoops from a small ladle) carefully pour the batter on to the skillet. Leave them alone while they bubble. When you have an even layer of bubbles across the pancakes youre ready to flip. It looks like this when theyre ALMOST ready:Flip the cakes and while they are still on the griddle put a pat of butter on them to melt inUse a butter knife as the butter melts to spread it around and keep it from sliding off the pancake.

I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just cant simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesnt stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if youre passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer.Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can’t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission.

Inherently, there’s no value in paper money. You can’t eat paper money. You can’t cloth yourself with paper money (although, I guess if you got enough of it, you could wrap yourself up in it like toilet paper…). You can’t make a house out of paper. Money is not important to dogs or farm animals, or bacteria. Yet still, money is one of the leading factors that keep the world in order. I’ve been particularly fascinated with understanding money for the last year or so, both for selfish and philosophical reasons. I’ve been trying to understand money because I want to learn how I can make more of it, but I also want to make sure I can do so without becoming someone I can’t stand. These are the 7 lessons on money that I’ve learned in the last year that have helped me the most.  If you want more money, you have to ask for it. I’ve been working with one of my freelance clients for a little over a year, and a few weeks ago, I decided that I needed to raise my freelancing rates in order to better allocate my time. I’d love to tell you that I just called the guy and told him I needed more money, but I didn’t. Instead, I freaked out about it in my head for around 3 weeks. I let myself get super worked up and anxious over a single question. This is a bad habit I’m working on. Eventually, I did work up the courage to ask the guy for an increase in pay, and the craziest thing happened: He just said, “sure.” Sometimes, you just have to ask and see what happens.  No one will tell you how much your time and skills are worth. When I started teaching private lessons in Jiu-Jitsu, I had no idea how money worked. The fact that people were paying me to do Jiu-Jitsu with them was mind-boggling to my 21-year-old brain. I charged $50 per lesson and gave away every 4th lesson for free. I did this until I realized that I’d have to teach 20 personal lessons to make just $1000 per month. I realized that I had to change my price in order to live. No one told me that my price was cheap (at first); they just took advantage of me offering a decent quality product at an affordable price. I accidentally turned myself into fast food. To avoid doing this yourself, you have to build genuine self-esteem and self-awareness of your skills. You have to get good at what you do and then develop the confidence that you are good at doing it. Usually, you have to start with a leap of faith.  Most people do not want to pay you for anything. If you work for free, people will hire you. If you write a free ebook, people will download it. This is not a good or a bad thing; this is just a statement. People like free stuff. They don’t mind paying for stuff, but it’s harder to get people to buy things than it is to give things to them for free. Most people will take the free sample, but only a few will stay and become your customers. This is how business works. Get used to it.  It’s not what you do, it’s how well you can do it. When I decided that I wanted to do Jiu-Jitsu professionally, most people told me that I was going to be broke. Most people also told me that writers are broke. Most people are pretty negative when it comes to achieving and living dreams. They’re also wrong. Our culture is broken existentially, and while I think about that a lot, it’s a problem for another day. The point is, if you’re undeniably good at what you do and aren’t terrible at sales (you don’t have to be good at sales, necessarily), you will live. The best writers don’t just “make a living”, they make a very good living. The same is true with the best martial artists. Focus on getting good and putting yourself out there. The rest will follow.  If someone else is paying you, it’s more difficult to create a lot of wealth. There are exceptions to this — obviously, there are plenty of high-paying jobs that do not require one to be an entrepreneur. However, “making money” isn’t really the entire point. If you have money but no peace of mind, no time, and poor health, your money is less valuable. Your money is probably going to be spent on your physical and mental health in a desperate effort to give yourself more time on this earth. For some people, having a boss gives them peace of mind and security. For me, because I’ve got an attitude (thanks, Dad), having a boss makes me feel like I’m being suffocated slowly. For me, having a boss makes me visibly angry. For me, having a boss makes it more difficult to make money because having a boss makes it more difficult for me to do a job. You need to know yourself.  Your financial success will make people uncomfortable (including yourself). Lots of people have a strange fear of money. I still feel this fear sometimes. I’ve come a long way in terms of getting over insecurities, but I’m still not perfect. I also don’t mean fear in the traditional sense of the word when it comes to money. People aren’t scared of having money. They’re scared of other people close to them having more money than them. They’re scared of this because they think that money changes people. Money doesn’t change you. It exposes poor character—more on that in a second. ...","oney is a social construct.Paper money only has value because all of humanity has decided that it has value.

The downside is that this is cumbersome and time-consuming -- you cant walk around with bags of potatoes all day -- so as a solution the market naturally finds alternative commodities that are easier to trade, such as precious metals, which are chosen because they’re easy to carry, imperishable and have a limited supply, thus theoretically retaining value over time.Once society has established precious metals as the currency of choice, the ruling party decides to mould them into a consistent size/shape/weight to standardise their value -- this way you dont have to weigh your gold each time you trade. This is known as commodity money because its value is derived from the material out of which it is made.Eventually the amount of gold in circulation increases and people begin looking for a trustworthy place to store it. Banks begin to form and start issuing receipts for the gold deposited, which can be redeemed by anyone for gold at a later time (this is the first real appearance of paper money). This is known as representative money, and some people began trading these notes in lieu of coins, provided that the bank was trustworthy (e.g. Ill give you these 5 pieces of paper for that bag of potatoes, which you can redeem at X trustworthy bank for 50 gold coins).At some point the government decides to issue treasury notes (in the form of coins/paper money) in various denominations. These have no physical value but are backed by the government’s own gold holdings. These quickly become the representative currency of choice because anyone can exchange them for gold directly with the government. In 1971, the U.S. dropped the gold standard, meaning that treasury notes (money) were no longer convertible to gold -- dollars are now known as Fiat money, which is the system that most of the world uses today.The value of the currency comes primarily from future tax income flowing into the national treasury.

I have fairly frequently heard in the US the same question as this topic, and often the recipient will ask for a clarification as to what kind of mile—like statute or nautical—to which the original questioner would typically respond, “Yeah, you know, the statute mile like we use on land.” Typically neither the requester nor the responder actually realizes the consequences of how the clarification question is answered. In the United Kingdom it is easy: 1 mi = 5280 ft (by definition, so exact). In the United States, there are two kinds of miles and two kinds of feet that are relevant to this question. For both miles and feet, there is a pair of international units and a pair of survey units. Up to 1959–06–30, there was only one legal foot in the USA, whose length was equal to (1200/3937) m (technically the yard was (3600/3937) m, the foot was 1/3 of that yard and the inch was 1/36 of that yard—the intent was to make the inch such that 1 m =39.37 in, as Americans had a propensity to try to make the metric units look like they were defined in terms of American units, making it easier for Americans to convert metric measurements to US customary units). Vladimir mentioned in his answer a 1593 act of Parliament that in essence set the mile equal to 5280 ft; this mile ended up being called a statute mile because it was defined by a legal statute. The US had the same relationship between the statute mile and the foot, namely a factor of 5280. The first problem was that the US and the English-speaking members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) had different definitions of the yard—the US in terms of the meter and most commonwealth countries having a metal bar artifact, except Canada had defined the foot to be 0.3048 m (a different relation to the meter than the US). This mismatch was regarded as undesirable and representatives from these countries agreed in 1959 to define the yard as 0.9144 m, so the foot became 0.3048 m, matching Canada’s already existing definition, shortened the US definition by exactly 2 parts per million, and lengthened the UK foot by a bit. The UK adopted this new definition and applied it to all derived units, including the acre as land area, effective 1964–01–01. The US adopted the new definition immediately and applied it to all derived units (including volume measures such as gallon) that were not associated with land measurement. (Thus the UK acre changed with the change of the yard but the US acre did not; the US gallon defined as 231 in³ changed with the change of the yard, but the UK gallon defined as the volume of 10 lb of distilled water at certain specified conditions did not.) The problem in the US was the existence of huge amounts of survey data that were based on the pre-1959 foot; though 2 parts per million change sounds small, it becomes very difficult to realign data points that are hundreds of miles apart. Therefore, the US retained the old foot, renaming it appropriately to “survey foot”, for anything related to survey maps and data. This meant that the rod, furlong, fathom (water depths showing up on maps), statute mile, and acre retained their pre-1959 size, and the statute mile stayed at 5280 survey-feet. The post-1959 foot became known as simply the foot (thus use of “foot” unmodified defaults to meaning the post-1959 foot of 0.3048 m); however, if there was any risk of ambiguity, the new foot would be referred to explicitly as the “international foot”. Thus, nominally (more about this weasel word later) 1 statute mile is: exactly 5280 survey feet and exactly [(5280 × 1200 / 3937) / 0.3048] feet, which is approximately 5280.010 56 feet. Now, there was also an adjustment to the mile to keep its relation to the adjusted foot with the factor 5280. This mile is known more explicitly as the “international mile” in parallel with the foot. There are 4 names for “land” miles (not counting nautical miles and some other really obscure miles): mile, international mile, statute mile, survey mile—the first two are synonymous with each other. Now it gets really complicated. The United States is a federal system, meaning the national (usually called federal) government has authority over all commerce (which includes weights and measures) that crosses state borders, whereas each state has authority for activities within the confines of the state. At the federal level and within most states the statute mile is synonymous with the survey mile, but supposedly in eight states all length/area/volume measurements have been adjusted to conform to the post-1959 definition of the yard and foot, so that the statute mile is synonymous with the international mile (and the acre is 4640 yd², not 4640 survey-yd²). The bottom line is:1 mi = 5280 ft = 1609.344 m (exactly) in all jurisdictions of the US;1 st mi = 5280 survey-ft = 5280.010 56… ft = 1609.3472… m at the national level and in most states,…………. 5280 ft = 1609.344 m in a few states.It is because of the two different values here for “the” statute mile that triggered my used of “nominally” earlier in this post and that I would have more about this—well, here it is. The use of “nominally” is because it is the definition and value used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and most, but not all, states have adopted. Most people do not care about this small of a difference—they would never notice. However, definitions need to be set up so that one definition covers everybody, including researchers and makers of precision equipment for whom this is a big difference as well as the common folk who do not care at all. I have actually worked in an application where the distinction between an international mile and the survey mile came up because an important error showed up in a simulation that mixed up the conversion factors between survey units versus international units and metric units. For the life of me I do not understand why so many Americans fight so hard to retain use of the US customary units and resist using metric units. They talk about how hard the metric system is and how easy to deal with the American units. When they do, I cannot help but think about issues with the number of feet in a mile, avoirdupois ounces versus troy ounces versus fluid ounces, how big is a bushel (which varies from state to state and commodity to commodity and often has little to do with the NIST definition), and numerous other oddities that make me wonder how anybody can think this is easier than the metric system. Then I remember Americans do not care enough—they live in blissful ignorance having a hard time remembering how many inches are in a yard and most really do not care that they do not know. It is very sad.","he answer to the question is far more complicated than one might think.

Once the water is boiling, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. 5. Let the eggs sit in the hot water for the desired amount of time, depending on how soft or hard you want your yolks to be. - For soft-boiled eggs with a runny yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 4-6 minutes. - For medium-boiled eggs with a slightly runny yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 7-8 minutes. - For hard-boiled eggs with a fully set yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 9-12 minutes. 6. When the eggs are done, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the pot and transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool down quickly. This will help to prevent the yolks from turning green and will make them easier to peel. 7. Once the eggs are cool, gently tap them on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel the shell off with your fingers or a spoon. Tips: - If youre boiling a large number of eggs, its best to do them in batches to ensure even cooking. - To make peeling the eggs easier, add a teaspoon of vinegar or salt to the water before boiling. - For perfectly round and evenly cooked eggs, use an egg timer or a digital timer to keep track of the cooking time.

It is a general term used to describe any software that is designed to perform an unauthorized or harmful action. Malware can be used to steal personal information, like credit card numbers, passwords, and bank account information. It can also be used to gain access to a computer system without the owners knowledge. Because of these potential problems, there are two things you can do; 1) protect your computer against future malware infections and 2) manually remove malware from your computer. Here’s how you do it: 1. Protect your computer against future malware infections Installing a malware removal tool on your computer is one of the best ways to prevent future malware infections and remove existing ones. A malware removal tool is a program that is designed to scan a computer for malware and remove it. There are many malware removal extensions for Chrome but the one we recommend is Guardio. Full disclaimer, this is our Chrome extension. Guardio is an anti-malware program that removes existing malware from your computer and prevents new malware infections. It does this by blocking harmful sites, extensions, and push notification providers that try to insert malware on your computer. Our dashboard provides you insights on your past activity like how many harmful websites, information leaks, suspicious websites, search hijackers, and intrusive pop-ups it has blocked.After you install Guardio on Chrome, it will automatically scan your computer to look for unwanted popups, information leaks, harmful apps, and to check your overall system health. If it finds a problem, it will automatically remove the malware source. Then it will work in the background to keep you safe while you browse through the internet. 2. Manually remove malware from your computer. Chrome has a feature that allows you to scan your computer for malware and remove it. It’s great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections. To start scanning your computer, all you have to do is visit your Chrome settings and at the bottom of the page, under “Advanced” you’ll find a section called, “Reset and clean up”.Click “Clean up computer” and then “Find” to start scanning your computer. After it finishes removing the malware it finds, you’ll be asked to restart your computer. Do it and you’ll have completed the process. Again, this process is great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections so add an extra layer of security to stay safe while browsing the internet. Install a malware removal tool like Guardio and have peace of mind in knowing that it will actively work to protect you. We hope you found this information helpful and that you are able to fully remove malware from your computer.

Not wanting to disappoint my guest, I gave it a taste, added a little more pizza sauce, and a pinch of salt, and declared it to be a perfect pureed pizza. After a quick trip in the microwave, it had gotten cold from the water and pureeing, we sent it out to the guest who was insanely happy. We were told that they had been craving pizza for years since no one was willing to puree one for them. So, the best way to eat a slice of pizza is any way that you are able to. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Well its pretty self-explanatory in my opinion.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersIncorrect: Listening to loud music slowly gives me a headache.Correct: When I listen to loud music, I slowly develop a headache.A squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy.

I am sure it may not be this way for all weddings out there. I am not even saying that this is the case for many weddings. But yes, if you are getting into this, you should always know that this is a possibility that you cannot ignore, and which no one would ever tell you. I hail from a typical middle class background, from a not-so-big town in (South) India, and after I turned 22, everyone around me was worried that now is the time for me to get married otherwise I would never get married/ bring shame to my family/ marry after my younger siblings get married/ run off with someone (yes, they said all these things in front of me!) so, yes, I needed to be married off to someone, who was not my boyfriend. Now, theres a culture in South India, if a family doesnt have a lot of money -- girls are married to their cousins/ mothers brother, where the age difference is not too much (say the mother was the eldest daughter, and brother was the youngest, with a huge age gap). This way, a girl stays within the family, and also there is no question of dowry, since they are family. Similar to this, my wedding was arranged right after I graduated from college, to my mama (mothers brother) who was a few years older than me. My case was complicated because I had a boyfriend already, and my family didnt approve of him when I told them about him (he was not South Indian, which was a mortal sin in my parents eyes). I tried to protest, but using the usual emotional blackmail arguments, my father forced me into the marriage - he was very sick at the time, and the onus was on me to fulfill his wishes. (Hes very much fine now, but I am inclined to think hell fall sick again when its my younger sisters turn to get married. Indian parents force you to think this stuff about themselves). I was forced to break off all contact with my boyfriend (mobile, internet snatched away, I dont think I could even have sent a letter, it was so bad) and forced to dive head-first into the wedding arrangements. The day of the wedding came, and after a really embarrassing lecture from my mother, about my marital duties since I was the eldest daughter and no friends had been allowed to my wedding (my parents believed they would whisk me away from the wedding if they came to know), I got ready for the wedding night. I was already feeling completely shitty about the whole thing, having been cut off from every person that I wanted to be with, being married to my mama in secrecy, and not even knowing whether to think of him as a husband or my mama, and  just wanted to sleep hoping a new day would bring a new start. I waited for my husband to come and when he entered, we exchanged a few awkward sentences about the whole day being tiresome. I then told him Im feeling very tired, I will change and go to sleep now but I was not prepared for what happened next. He suddenly kissed me, and I was a little taken aback, but I just pulled away slowly, and told him that I was not in the mood, and reiterated that I was very tired. He ignored me completely, and kissed me again, this time with more force, and when I tried to push him away, he slapped me. This was followed by the most horrible experience of my life, the details of which shake me to this day, and I somehow escaped by locking myself in the bathroom. I knew I had nobody to turn to -- he was my mothers brother, and my father was sick. Even if these were not the circumstances, I doubt anyone would have supported me. I stayed in this abusive marriage for a few months, which was the darkest period of my life. Thankfully, I was not foolish, and I had a job to support myself, unlike a lot of other women out there, suffering daily. I ran away, before it was too late. Now, nobody in my family knows where I am, and what happened. I am sure they must say the worst things about me, and mention my name with disgust and shame. But this is one decision that I made with careful deliberation and I will not let myself regret it. I am considerably happier now, very much single, with no intention of getting married again. I am happy to have put this behind me, but want to extend my support for all those women who are in the same situation as I was. One experience is enough to scar you for life. EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the response and emotional support I have received from so many people here. Also, I want to thank everyone who promoted my answer so it can reach more women like me. The memories are still fresh, and will take time to fade away, but it will.  In any case, this prompted me to contact my sister, and I finally did talk to her. I pretty much expected what would happen, but I finally confirmed that my parents hate me, and somehow this is after knowing what had happened.My husband complained to them that I wouldnt put out, and was a disobedient and unfaithful wife, and some synonyms of whore. My sister is suffering at home, but shes doing well otherwise. I have arranged for her to meet me, and well see where it goes. I hope everything will become all right. EDIT 2:Although I was expecting some hate, but one particular comment struck me hard -- Mama had a wrong preconceived notion about you because you previously had a boyfriend...Er?  This seems to me a version of Men are allowed to rape women who have boyfriends because they are immoral. I urge people to change their views about women and morality, respect and rape. I wrote it here because a lot of people are seeing this answer. I hope people change their thinking. EDIT 3: So someone asked me to include what happened to the boyfriend. Unfortunately, theres no happy ending on that side as everyone is hoping. He got married to someone else while all this was happening, and I dont hold him responsible for anything, he deserves to have a good life too. Anyway, thank you everyone for the enormous support, I have started to doubt myself less, and now my sister is living with me. Shes getting married soon (to someone she likes) and as for me, I will see where I go next. EDIT 4:Today I read thisMy Mother Got Me Married To My Cousin And My Wedding Night Is The Most Horrific Memory Of My LifeIt seems eerily similar to what I went through. Im not sure if this is real (I get the irony of my comment), but it seems more people are going through the same thing."," was almost raped on my wedding night.

This whole episode has taken toll on my life. I am just floating in the stream of time. I left my job.. Flashback 14 months ago.. I wish I had asked my wife her views on sex before marriage. As it turned out she hated the idea of sex for some reasons. It ruined a beautiful thing for me and now I just dragging through the marriage. Ours was arranged marriage. We met few times before marriage but never really were able to discuss intimate things. Our fault.. not to blame the Indian arranged marriage system. We both are science graduates. With age difference of around 4 years. After the wedding, first night we didnt touch each other. Just talked and slept. It was both awkward for me and her. Furthermore we were at my native place not in my city so the place was also not familiar. When we returned to my city, I made the first move as boys are supposed to. Kissed and caressed her. She seemed okay with it but asked politely that she would need more time and that she is not ready for it.I agreed because I didnt want to force it. In few days she went to take her exams in another city and would come back a month later. In between we kept calling each other. I went to her city after the exams and booked a nice hotel there. Anticipating that she must have had her Time out by now. That night, she again refused but I pressed it further knowing that she might just be shy and needs a little push from my side. We got to the point where we were half naked, but as things started to happen, she strongly disapproved. Her theory was that we can get naked but no penetration. By this time I started to realize that there was something fishy about her. I was kind of in the zone. I was virgin. So, obviously excited as well as curious about all this. I got really upset. I firmly asked her to tell me the reason. She simply said that she doesnt want to get pregnant. It was the time when all things started to fall down for me. Is she really that stupid? Does she not know about condoms? Is she just trying to take me on a ride?What I expected was a strong, intellectual, passionate woman. Which I thought she was seeing her behaviour, her college degree. I was actually shattered. Is it me? Am I not likable? Why did she marry me in the first place? This marriage was mutual. As a matter of fact, she insisted on this to her parents more than I did. Disappointed and disheartened I was, I said to her in strong manner that I am ready to wait as long as she wants, but this is not what Id expected in the first place. I was able physically, mentally, financially and then I decided to marry. If she was not ready, she and her parents should have waited. Why did they choose me to go through all this? The thing which actually infuriated me was her pretence. She insisted that we should get to know each other better first, If she liked me, we could have sex. We should love each other first. And I was like, what did she just said?. Are you kidding me? First of all, she wasnt being honest with me, it had been a month, the wedding was already done, she was not with me in that period for her reasons, she was refusing me each time with some petty excuses, and she was expecting that the love would just miraculously appear and then she would be ready to do me the favour of letting me having sex with her. This just blew me off. I was so disgusted, and felt betrayed that how could someone assume that I was the one who needed all the sex? And do I have to behave to her in order to get the sex.. fuck off..  I said, if you think the kind of creature I am, let me tell you.. I will not touch you unless you want. You will crave for it.  The thoughts of divorce didnt appear in my mind because I never expected it to be this way. I still was hoping that maybe its me that wasnt trying hard enough, maybe she needs time. After this incident, we returned to my home town. I deliberately didnt touch her. Few weeks passed by. Things were normal on their face. She was behaving as a newly wed bride should behave with all the people in the family. Moreover, she also was behaving normally with me. To the point that she started to take the role of nagging wife, and few times asked me not to do that or this or to sleep early not to talk with my female colleagues so often on whatsapp. I was really observing all this with so much of disbelief. Wondering all the time, is this for real? Is really happening to me? Few weeks later, she made the move and came close. I didnt do anything, just waited. She just wanted my warmth I guess. But the cuddling of-course used to set me on. But frustratingly I couldnt do anything. I wanted her to crave for it. Little did I know that this woman wasnt a normal one. I was busy with office and frankly, I couldnt behave with her normally. Fuck off with the love, how could I love such a woman? One night, it was unbearable and almost charged and we were really passionate she was responding and I thought it was finally the time. And again, she just refused. I was on the verge of insanity by now. I explained her how difficult for a man it is just to lay with a girl, not doing anything. It is absurd. That was the time when I said that, I dont think it will work. Its not too late and we should get divorce. She started crying. Told me that she actully never wanted to get married just now. We are not talking here about a 17 year old, she was 23. I was flabbergasted. She was the one who insisted.  She said that her parents were set to marry her anyway, so she thought I was the best bet. She cried and said that not to talk about divorce. And she will behave, she also also accused me of not loving her and said that she cannot feel the love in my behaviour. I said that how could she love me if she is not letting me show my passion and refusing me every time with no apparent reason? How could be someone so ignorant? I couldnt love her, but now I started to feel kind of repulsion. No way this woman is normal. I asked if she has any other reason that she will let me know two months from now? I felt betrayed. You see, I am kind of person who cannot even hurt a nagging salesman. Many a times I just bought things because I felt bad for the salesman in a mall. This woman, whom I took as strong and independent was shaken by the thought of divorce. Instead of taking her own decisions she made a stupid move to get married because of parents and wanted her husband to take care of her denying him a good married life. How stupid and selfish a person can be? Agreed that Indian parents are hard on girls, but okay.. youve got a good husband now, you can drop the act now, enough. Okay, I might have managed without the sex. But, the controlling, nagging, taking me for granted? She even lent some money to her sister without letting me know. Id given her that money for her expenses. When I come to know and I disapproved that, she accused me of being narrow minded.WTF. I also came to know about her issues which could have been ignored had the marriage been working peacefully. I called her parents, I told them how she was behaving and what problems she had. But I did not mention the sex life. I was enraged. But I couldnt just shout at them, because thats not what I am. I was utterly feeling disgusted. However my cousin whom with I had shared my agony, told her mother about that. And her mothers response was-Oh my god, so thats the basic reason. So, I assumed that my wife had not told even her mother about this. Basically, this sick woman was doing all this on her own. She waited for my love to grow for her but I did not give a fuck. As I said Id offered her option of divorce, but she begged me not to go for it. And I had left with no choice but to drag through all this. Basically, if its not mutual, Indian divorces can turn ugly. I surely didnt want that to happen. Fast forward 8 months, we had sex. Several times. It just happened. It was too late. By that it had no meaning. She was insipid and mediocre in bed. My passion for sex died. She had successfully ruined not only sex, but woman intimacy for me. It deteriorated me on all fronts. Combined with work pressures, office politics, childhood traumas, remorse and what not, I felt like life took me the lowest point. I started having health issues such as severe stomach aches which I never had before in my life. The marriage which was supposed to heal me wounded me further. Now I am away from her. I am intelligent guy. Might not be too smart. So, brain figured out how to get away from this agony which is costing my family financially. Still not divorced. She calls me but the The miraculous love still hasnt appeared there, what a shame. She still demands that.. some people are just plain stupid. I dont think it has any cure.  This whole episode has taken toll on my life. I am just floating in the stream of time. I left my job. Took upon new challenges (?) and somehow getting by. I wander. I see new cities and places. I still blame myself of being stupid and going into marriage blindly. Basically, I did not imaging that life can screw me on unimaginable front. Sometimes I just think that whatever happened I wanted it to happen subconsciously. This is not possible otherwise. Sometimes I feel that how my life would have been if I had asked the girl in my office who was clearly hitting on me. What if the girl who I used to go out with had said yes to my proposal? What if I never had gone into the baloney of marriage. Sometimes I just feel that Cool.. my life is not like 9-6 Job, kids and die. Fucking awesome. I gonna write a novel.Basically, I now dwell in the zone where insanity and reasonability take charge of my behaviour by tossing a coin every day. Sun 9th August 2015.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit 1 : Tue 11th August 2015 Interesting responses. I am travelling and couldnt immediately reply to any comment. Which allowed me to think upon them. In summary - 1. Some people showed empathy. Honestly, it felt good. Thank you. Sometimes its enough when some heart resonates with yours. 2. Some people showed sympathy and pity.Dont be sorry for me. I seriously believe that life compensates for all. Everyone have problems in life. Mine is on this front. My case is nothing in comparison with whatever happened with some of the people who have shared their experiences in this or some other forums.My life till this point was good and I am learning ways to get around. There is plenty in this world to appreciate. I am doing that right now.  3. Some people accused me of being a sex maniac/ expecting only sex from marriage.- Am I? During my tenure in the last company, I had many opportunities to travel to exotic places in Europe. I was alone, I was single. Never ever I thought of hiring a hooker. It was too easily available. Actually, I dont think that a persons character can be judged by the fact that hes or has not enjoyed a sex workers service. But, surely, not doing it when nobody was their to judge me proves that I am not a sex maniac.I like sex, that doesnt mean I dream of hopping on each girl I see on my way. I appreciate beauty. But I hate eve teasers or people who make filthy comments about women. I enjoy good conversations with girls. I believe that women have gift of healing someone just with their gestures and appreciation. They can make or break some ones day  pretty easily if they want.There are other factors which I have briefly mentioned about why I lost interest in her. I didnt discuss it in detail because the question is about sex.  4. Some people downright added abusive comments.- Grow up. Stop watching filth like Rodies. 5. Some people say that I should have given her the time she demanded.- Read the  answer again. 8 months. 6. She clearly has some kind of aversion towards sex. She tried to cover that. Whose fault is that? Why didnt she discuss this with her family before or after marriage? If she did, why she and her parents went ahead anyway? If I or my family had done that to her? Assume that I had taken such a long time to have the dead sex. Assume that I had demanded love without acceptance. Pseudo-Feminists would have still accused me of ruining her life.My point is, till the time I came to know that she had some problem, I had to go through the embarrassment of trying to do it having no clue what was going on. She could have saved me that embarrassment by being honest in the first place. Damn it the whole thing was new and scary for me too. At least be sorry for not behaving the normal way. Instead she chose the pretense. It costed me a lot on emotional front. The people who have some prejudices about sex and watch a lot of cheesy melodramatic hindi movies, read the answer like - I wanted sex. she refused. I demanded sex she refused. She cried. Sex, sex. I went away.Coming close just for the warmth of my body was a metaphor for what my mind was going through - This woman married me just to seek comfortable life considering only herself and her family without giving a fuck about my emotions and my family. The selfishness in this construct repulsed me. And why the hell I should try and understand her if she is not even telling me the truth? Its like trying to help someone who is taking you as a fool. She had a job which she left without consulting me as soon as the marriage was fixed. I did not want her money. However, given a shortest possible time to choose your life partner some factors become decisive. For me, a woman taking her own care, confident, independent.. I liked it in my partner. I came to know about it, I got alarmed. But, you cannot just back out from a fixed marriage because your fiancée left job. You are not man enough to take care of your wife with your own money, you want her money.. right?There is a no return point in arrange marriages, and people make sure that it comes as soon as possible. Then this whole thing.. When I mentioned divorce, if she had faced that with dignity, I would have still liked it. I was not going to do it anyway. Again she made me feel bad by crying and mentioning how her family will feel and how she will feel.. where is me? Where are my emotions? 7. Some people said that these are plausible hazards of arrange marriages. Its a lottery anyway. Well, okay. I knew that. Why am I writing this.. well someone has to document the hazards right? I mean you see, I was not the person she sought, and she isnt the one I deserved. We are a clear mismatch. I said she was stupid because she took stupid decisions of beating around the bush without thinking of repercussions or without consulting the elders. 8. Am I spreading phobia of marriages.. why would I do that? Consider this just an account of an anonymous. As I am seeing it.. life goes on. 9. Someone ridiculed the anonymity as cowardliness.- Seriously? 10. Word of advice to kids.. when you work in something as exciting as programming or creating stuff, you tend to forget that someday you have to get married. One day you are enjoying your work, movies, quora and travelling in Himalayas, the other day your parents and ever caring aunts come up with rishtas - marriage prospects. They use all sorts of techniques to get you onboard - Dekhne mai kya harj hai? We are not going to force you, but you should also consider our emotions.  We have promised them that we would visit them etc etc. It is true for both guys and girls.  The point is you will have to go through this. So, dont be delusional that you will continue to avoid it. 90% times, they will catch you by surprise. So, be prepared in advance. If it has to be done, do it as you will do as a project. Its your life. Whatever happens after marriage, at least you will not feel that you could have put more efforts in finding your partner. 11. For those who do not liked that I wrote about this subject.- Please do not curse me. Its not of any use to you. This answer should make you more informed. Use your own discretion before making any conclusions. You dont know me fully. I am not a writer (um.. yet.. novel someday..), so take whatever is useful and leave out whatever you perceive as junk. I have not asked you to believe me. If you want, consider this work of fiction and move on.If you dont like someone talking about sex, why are you reading answers in this category in the first place? The question was about sex, I had to write more because of the comments. Sorry for that.","kay lots of  woman perspective. Here is Indian guy. Software professional. Not to brag, just to alert them.

Here is Indian guy. Software professional. Not to brag, just to alert them. This whole episode has taken toll on my life. I am just floating in the stream of time. I left my job.. Flashback 14 months ago.. I wish I had asked my wife her views on sex before marriage. As it turned out she hated the idea of sex for some reasons. It ruined a beautiful thing for me and now I just dragging through the marriage. Ours was arranged marriage. We met few times before marriage but never really were able to discuss intimate things. Our fault.. not to blame the Indian arranged marriage system. We both are science graduates. With age difference of around 4 years. After the wedding, first night we didnt touch each other. Just talked and slept. It was both awkward for me and her. Furthermore we were at my native place not in my city so the place was also not familiar. When we returned to my city, I made the first move as boys are supposed to. Kissed and caressed her. She seemed okay with it but asked politely that she would need more time and that she is not ready for it.I agreed because I didnt want to force it. In few days she went to take her exams in another city and would come back a month later. In between we kept calling each other. I went to her city after the exams and booked a nice hotel there. Anticipating that she must have had her Time out by now. That night, she again refused but I pressed it further knowing that she might just be shy and needs a little push from my side. We got to the point where we were half naked, but as things started to happen, she strongly disapproved. Her theory was that we can get naked but no penetration. By this time I started to realize that there was something fishy about her. I was kind of in the zone. I was virgin. So, obviously excited as well as curious about all this. I got really upset. I firmly asked her to tell me the reason. She simply said that she doesnt want to get pregnant. It was the time when all things started to fall down for me. Is she really that stupid? Does she not know about condoms? Is she just trying to take me on a ride?What I expected was a strong, intellectual, passionate woman. Which I thought she was seeing her behaviour, her college degree. I was actually shattered. Is it me? Am I not likable? Why did she marry me in the first place? This marriage was mutual. As a matter of fact, she insisted on this to her parents more than I did. Disappointed and disheartened I was, I said to her in strong manner that I am ready to wait as long as she wants, but this is not what Id expected in the first place. I was able physically, mentally, financially and then I decided to marry. If she was not ready, she and her parents should have waited. Why did they choose me to go through all this? The thing which actually infuriated me was her pretence. She insisted that we should get to know each other better first, If she liked me, we could have sex. We should love each other first. And I was like, what did she just said?. Are you kidding me? First of all, she wasnt being honest with me, it had been a month, the wedding was already done, she was not with me in that period for her reasons, she was refusing me each time with some petty excuses, and she was expecting that the love would just miraculously appear and then she would be ready to do me the favour of letting me having sex with her. This just blew me off. I was so disgusted, and felt betrayed that how could someone assume that I was the one who needed all the sex? And do I have to behave to her in order to get the sex.. fuck off..  I said, if you think the kind of creature I am, let me tell you.. I will not touch you unless you want. You will crave for it.  The thoughts of divorce didnt appear in my mind because I never expected it to be this way. I still was hoping that maybe its me that wasnt trying hard enough, maybe she needs time. After this incident, we returned to my home town. I deliberately didnt touch her. Few weeks passed by. Things were normal on their face. She was behaving as a newly wed bride should behave with all the people in the family. Moreover, she also was behaving normally with me. To the point that she started to take the role of nagging wife, and few times asked me not to do that or this or to sleep early not to talk with my female colleagues so often on whatsapp. I was really observing all this with so much of disbelief. Wondering all the time, is this for real? Is really happening to me? Few weeks later, she made the move and came close. I didnt do anything, just waited. She just wanted my warmth I guess. But the cuddling of-course used to set me on. But frustratingly I couldnt do anything. I wanted her to crave for it. Little did I know that this woman wasnt a normal one. I was busy with office and frankly, I couldnt behave with her normally. Fuck off with the love, how could I love such a woman? One night, it was unbearable and almost charged and we were really passionate she was responding and I thought it was finally the time. And again, she just refused. I was on the verge of insanity by now. I explained her how difficult for a man it is just to lay with a girl, not doing anything. It is absurd. That was the time when I said that, I dont think it will work. Its not too late and we should get divorce. She started crying. Told me that she actully never wanted to get married just now. We are not talking here about a 17 year old, she was 23. I was flabbergasted. She was the one who insisted.  She said that her parents were set to marry her anyway, so she thought I was the best bet. She cried and said that not to talk about divorce. And she will behave, she also also accused me of not loving her and said that she cannot feel the love in my behaviour. I said that how could she love me if she is not letting me show my passion and refusing me every time with no apparent reason? How could be someone so ignorant? I couldnt love her, but now I started to feel kind of repulsion. No way this woman is normal. I asked if she has any other reason that she will let me know two months from now? I felt betrayed. You see, I am kind of person who cannot even hurt a nagging salesman. Many a times I just bought things because I felt bad for the salesman in a mall. This woman, whom I took as strong and independent was shaken by the thought of divorce. Instead of taking her own decisions she made a stupid move to get married because of parents and wanted her husband to take care of her denying him a good married life. How stupid and selfish a person can be? Agreed that Indian parents are hard on girls, but okay.. youve got a good husband now, you can drop the act now, enough. Okay, I might have managed without the sex. But, the controlling, nagging, taking me for granted? She even lent some money to her sister without letting me know. Id given her that money for her expenses. When I come to know and I disapproved that, she accused me of being narrow minded.WTF. I also came to know about her issues which could have been ignored had the marriage been working peacefully. I called her parents, I told them how she was behaving and what problems she had. But I did not mention the sex life. I was enraged. But I couldnt just shout at them, because thats not what I am. I was utterly feeling disgusted.

But we were talking each day on phone during courtship period. Once we both were comfortable enough to talk about sex, I conveyed her that I cant wait to touch her.

Her hands were very soft and smooth but she was feeling shy and she pushed me away from her. I sensed her shyness so I stepped back. Then we changed to our normal clothes, talked a bit and hit the bed to call it a day. But around midnight, she whispered in my ears “you were saying something before marriage”. I was confused so I aksed what incident she is referring to. She held my hands and reminded me about me wishing to touch her. This immediately turned me on but I was trying hard to control and asked her if shes comfortable then only Ill think about it. She nodded her head which meant she also wanted some action on wedding night. I was a virgin and all time single, I had no idea about how to do it. I started with kissing on her cheeks, forehead, hands. She was wearing red lipstick and I couldnt wait to kiss her on lips and I aksed her permission if I can kiss her on lips but she immediately kissed me on lips. Her red lipstick was now on my lips as well. After kissing for 2–3 minutes my tool became very hard. I removed my clothes and I was in underwear only. My erect tool was clearly visible. I asked my wife if she allow then I would like to undress her. She allowed and I undressed her. She was in her bra and panty, I couldnt open her bra as I didnt know how to open it but she helped me and removed her bra. For the first time in my life I saw boobs in real. She has perfect boobs, neither too big nor too small just perfect like I wished for. I couldnt control myself and didnt take permission this time and straight away started licking her boobs while fondling other boob with my hand. I was so much indulged in sucking, licking, pinching her boobs that I spent atleast 15–20 minutes in worshipping her boobs. She was also feeling my tool from the underwear and she suddenly pulled my underwear down to see my tool. I have an average tool (almost 5 inches in length) and the touch of her soft hands on my penis made it very hard like an iron bar. She started massaging and squeezing my balls and in no time I cummed very hard. I never cummed this much semen ever before. My wife wanted me to lick her pussy but Im a vegetarian and was quite hesitant in doing it. But I fingered her pussy. She liked it very much and she started moaning but our relatives and guests were sleeping in adjacent rooms so I had to cover her mouth with my hands so no one hears the moaning. After fingering her for quite good time my tool became hard again which earlier went down after 1st cum. Im a smart guy and I already bought condoms in advance. I took the condom, rolled it up my penis and asked my wife I can do actual sex with her. She also wanted to feel me inside her and she was ready. But I couldnt find the hole. It took me 2–3 minutes to enter the right place and then I started pounding her pussy. As it was my first time so I couldnt do it properly and I came within 2 minutes of pounding her pussy. Then we took a small nap of 10 minutes hugging each other tightly, then we got up and cleaned all the mess, I carefully wrapped the used condom in a paper and threw it in dustbin. Then we wore some clothes and hit the bed to sleep again at around 3AM. We were so tired by then that we fell in deep sleep within 5 minutes. Next day, my family members kept knocking the door but we were in deep sleep and didnt know about any door knocking. Finally, my wife woke up around 9:30 AM which is not a good time to wake up for a new bride, she then also woke me up and I opened the door. All of my relatives were waiting for us to wake up as we had to go to few temples and they were getting late due to us. My bhabhis, elder cousins started teasing me and my wife by asking embarrassing questions like why we woke up so late, why didnt we sleep on time yesterday night, we were knocking the door for 30 minutes etc. But the embarrassment was worth it for me and my wife.","or me it was very exciting.

My wife wanted me to lick her pussy but Im a vegetarian and was quite hesitant in doing it. But I fingered her pussy. She liked it very much and she started moaning but our relatives and guests were sleeping in adjacent rooms so I had to cover her mouth with my hands so no one hears the moaning. After fingering her for quite good time my tool became hard again which earlier went down after 1st cum. Im a smart guy and I already bought condoms in advance. I took the condom, rolled it up my penis and asked my wife I can do actual sex with her. She also wanted to feel me inside her and she was ready. But I couldnt find the hole. It took me 2–3 minutes to enter the right place and then I started pounding her pussy. As it was my first time so I couldnt do it properly and I came within 2 minutes of pounding her pussy. Then we took a small nap of 10 minutes hugging each other tightly, then we got up and cleaned all the mess, I carefully wrapped the used condom in a paper and threw it in dustbin. Then we wore some clothes and hit the bed to sleep again at around 3AM. We were so tired by then that we fell in deep sleep within 5 minutes. Next day, my family members kept knocking the door but we were in deep sleep and didnt know about any door knocking. Finally, my wife woke up around 9:30 AM which is not a good time to wake up for a new bride, she then also woke me up and I opened the door. All of my relatives were waiting for us to wake up as we had to go to few temples and they were getting late due to us. My bhabhis, elder cousins started teasing me and my wife by asking embarrassing questions like why we woke up so late, why didnt we sleep on time yesterday night, we were knocking the door for 30 minutes etc. But the embarrassment was worth it for me and my wife. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

I then dry the bread by placing it on a rack for a day or so. Then, the night before I am going to serve the french toast, I make the custard.  To make the custard I start with 4 eggs, I then whisk in a shot and half of bourbon, a dash of vanilla, cinnamon, real maple syrup and/or brown sugar, and a heavy pinch of salt.  Then I whisk in half and half (ok I am a heavy man and whisk in cream).  I stop when the custard drips off the whisk at a similar rate as molasses.

It is the rare and exceptional person who can make meaningful and intimate connections with their partner on any kind of regular basis, and it takes another exceptional and rare partner to form that kind of tender and “cute” couple we all envy. They do exist, but I don’t count myself as one of them, and all of the long term couples I know don’t fit that mold either. That is not to say that intimacy and understanding aren’t important to a long term partnership, because they are, but these attributes characterize the rare highlights of your life together, rather than the staples that ultimately keep the relationship going. In my view, the first ingredient to long term love is acceptance. If you stay with a partner long enough you will eventually see the ugly, flawed qualities within themselves that they try desperately to hide from everyone else. We are all both devils and saints. Your partner will eventually hurt you, momentarily lose your respect, and trod over your feelings and ambitions at some point in some way. You have to be able to accept them for who they are. You have to be able to forgive them when they hurt you. You have to be able to transition from the fantasy you create in your mind for a person when you fall in love with them, to the person they actually are once you get to really know them. It takes years to uncover those secrets. And people continue to change. Staying in love means committing to loving the new person your partner becomes. You have to be able to accept them. The second thing you need is to be good friends. If you can’t tolerate being in the same room with the other person then you aren’t in love. In my opinion, it is more important to be able to laugh together, to share experiences with one another, and to be able to carry a conversation this it is to have great sex or to be a great confidant for one another’s feelings. A lasting friendship smooths out the rough transitions in your life. Over the years and decades there will be baggage you carry with you, and issues you never resolve. That is a part of the deal. A good friendship can let you table those rough spots long enough for you to heal and come to terms with it. You stay good friends even when you aren’t good lovers. It is more reliable than any other aspect of your relationship. The last thing you need, again in my opinion, is a shared life direction. Raising children is a good one for many people. The stuff that really matters to you needs to be important to that other person. When you are pursuing your goals you need your partner to bring more to the table than they take away. What they bring to you can be asymmetrical and incomplete; deficiencies in income can be compensate with emotional support; as an example. But the net effect needs to be that they make your life easier than it would be without them. Having everything you need for a lasting relationship doesn’t guarantee the long haul. Couples break up for a lot of reasons. You are the person you are and your partner is the same. You can reach conflict that you can’t move past, or uncover qualities that you can’t swallow, or a momentary lapse in judgement can sow hurt and betrayal that you can’t heal from. It takes some luck in addition to compatibility to keep going. With that being said, I think long term relationships get easier as time goes by. If you are both happy and developing as people, you can learn to be better partners and better people through the life you share together."," have been in a relationship with my spouse for more than ten years.

She keeps calling. I tried to close the window but she just doesnt go. She says shell come to our home. and he started crying. Then he passed the phone to my mother. She told me that hes been very worried about it for the last 3 days. He hadnt even been able to sleep or concentrate in his school work. I never really saw how the lady looked like and I know it wouldnt have been any close, but in his description, it was something like this: Being a computer immature herself, my mother didnt know much about computer viruses and so wasnt very assuring in her condolences to him that nothing was wrong. Therefore, to save the family from the stranger internet lady, my little brother had heroically shut down the computer and boxed it up in a carton.  Before he called me to tell this, I was having one of the other normal days of my life. But while I was listening to the both of them, I felt something different. A feeling like you want a kangroo pocket to keep him in, always close to yourself. I felt that I can go on listening to his silly stories for even another lifetime after this. Every time I go home, we go for a drive and God would know that there isnt one person on this planet whom Id like more on the front seat while I drive than I want him there! Ive caught myself making a hundred excuses to not meet the rest of the world when Im home just so Id have more time with him. We cook together. We go to the library. We play Ludo.  He has tiny arms. When he is sleeping besides me, sometimes, he holds me from the neck to get a good grip and sleeps, leaving me in the most uncomfortable position, but as Im struggling to breathe air into my lungs, Im infinitely more thankful than I am uncomfortable. I cant imagine a life without him and his little stories. His little voice on the other side of the phone makes me go gaga like no one elses does. This must be love.

You need to constantly participate in taking surveys every day.Affiliate MarketingAlternatively, you can become an affiliate marketer. I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just cant simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesnt stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if youre passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer.Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can’t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission. So, my answer to your question - become a blogger/ affiliate marketer. Hope the answer helps.

Once the water is boiling, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. 5. Let the eggs sit in the hot water for the desired amount of time, depending on how soft or hard you want your yolks to be. - For soft-boiled eggs with a runny yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 4-6 minutes. - For medium-boiled eggs with a slightly runny yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 7-8 minutes. - For hard-boiled eggs with a fully set yolk, let the eggs sit in the hot water for 9-12 minutes. 6. When the eggs are done, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the pot and transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool down quickly. This will help to prevent the yolks from turning green and will make them easier to peel. 7. Once the eggs are cool, gently tap them on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel the shell off with your fingers or a spoon. Tips: - If youre boiling a large number of eggs, its best to do them in batches to ensure even cooking. - To make peeling the eggs easier, add a teaspoon of vinegar or salt to the water before boiling. - For perfectly round and evenly cooked eggs, use an egg timer or a digital timer to keep track of the cooking time. In conclusion, boiling an egg is a simple and quick process that can be done in just a few minutes.

It isn’t enough to have a standout resume or CV. You need an introductory email or cover letter to go with it. The greeting “Dear Hiring Manager” is too generic, and using “Dear Sir” when the person reading your cover email could be a she is a bad call. You need to find out the name of the person who screens applicants, his or her title (Ms.? Mr.? Dr.?), as well as his or her position. Usually, a quick web search yields the information you need. You can also phone the receptionist. This looks much more professional: Ms. Antoinette Nelson Manager, IT Support Services Persephone Corporation Re: the job The person you are writing to may be recruiting for several positions at once. Make that person’s life easier. Include a quick reference to the job you’re applying to upfront. It’s as simple as adding: Re: IT Analyst position Dear Ms. Nelson, The first paragraph “I’m applying for the Systems Analyst position” is unnecessary, because it’s obvious with the “Re: Systems Analyst position.” Besides, that’s boring, and you want to stand out. Instead, tell why you’re applying for this particular job, in this particular company. Give a real reason—and one that does not reflect your own self-interest, i.e. the high salary range being offered. If someone has referred you to a particular manager, mention her name and company. You are looking to forge a connection right from the start. If you don’t have a reference, consider leading with a question: “Are you looking for a proven IT professional? One with cutting-edge skills and dedication to customer service?” Tell why the position is your dream job, and why you’re uniquely qualified. If you’re struggling to get the words down, it may be because you haven’t done your homework. Research the company. Check the news. Find out which charities they support. You can then admire—and be inspired—by what they do: Consuelo Rivas at SafeTech suggested I get in touch with you. I have long admired what Persephone is doing in the Twin Cities—working with underprivileged youth—to prepare them for STEM careers. In fact, my experience with a Persephone mentor now inspires me to join the tech company that changed my life. This opening paragraph for a recent graduate works because it intrigues and connects with the hiring manager. The second paragraph Here’s where you give a short career summary and you tell the hiring manager why you should be selected for the job. “I’m a recent graduate with a 3.8 GPA” won’t make you stand out. Don’t regurgitate your resume; the recruiter can read. Your cover letter is made to supplement your resume, not repeat it. Instead, try telling a story that makes you desirable, that shows you would make a good addition to the team. Humans are wired to appreciate a good anecdote. If you make an assertion, support it. If you’ve led a team, what you’ve learned would make a great example. If your work ethic is superior, or you’ve demonstrated customer service that went above and beyond, tell that story (bonus if it makes the recruiter laugh). Comb for resume highlights and explain what one or two of those experiences taught you. If you don’t have all the requirements for the position, don’t apologize and don’t mention them. There’s no need to point out potential failings. As a direct result of that experience, I made better choices as a teenager. I took all the math and science courses I could, and I made stellar grades. That led to a full four-year scholarship at Rensselaer, where I stayed an extra year to get my Master’s Degree. Ms. Rivas supervised me at SafeTech during my summer internship. She taught me that it takes more than skills and straight A’s to succeed; it takes total dedication to getting the job done right. I found that out when I assisted Ms. Rivas for the 17 hours and the 5 lattes it took to accomplish a tricky database transfer. This paragraph works because it’s personal and it deepens the connection to the recruiter. It also lets her know that the applicant has figured out what it takes to advance in her chosen profession. The conclusion Three paragraphs are fine. If you’ve done your job with the cover letter, the hiring manager will want to know you better. The concluding paragraph gives you the opportunity to seal the deal. This won’t: “I look forward to hearing from you.” Why? It’s reactive rather than proactive. It says you’ll wait to hear from the recruiter. Instead, show you’re a go-getter. In today’s tight job market, words do count. The hiring company needs employees who can communicate clearly and concisely. Your cover letter then serves two purposes; it introduces you and it passes that test (the one you probably didn’t know you were taking). Here’s a better way: I’d love to show you what I can do. I’ll call Thursday morning next week. You can reach me at 612-555-6162, or at XXX@gmail.com. Thank you for your time and consideration—and for being a company that cares about children. Not only has the applicant thanked the manager for her time and consideration, but she did it in a way that demonstrates her passion and commitment. You can do the same thing, by choosing your verbs carefully (“love” conquers “like”). The applicant remembered to include contact information, so the hiring manager doesn’t have to go searching for it. And she promised to follow up. Finally, she has connected once more and shows that she is future-thinking. The most desirable employee is always going to be one that learns fast, who can quickly adapt to new technologies coming down the pike, and who looks for the better answer instead of the easy one.

As such, housing prices varies depending on where you are. Obviously, housing will be cheaper in the middle of nowhere versus housing along the coastal cities. I’m assuming, though, that you are looking for a house in the suburban area of California, near LA, San Francisco, etc. I live in an upper middle-class neighborhood in LA’s suburb. My house, which is the cheapest one in the neighborhood (as per Zillow), is valued at around $700k. Now, granted, my neighborhood is in the upper middle class (but still nowhere near the most expensive). You can definitely find cheaper housing elsewhere in the LA metro area, but I seriously doubt you’re going to find anything cheaper than $500k. In fact, if you do find a house cheaper than $500k in Los Angeles, I would advise you to NOT purchase that home. Most likely, that house is either in the middle of Compton (very dangerous place), or it needs a lot of “tender loving care”. Now that we’ve established the approximate price range of housing that you’ll be looking at… let’s get started:You will need at least $125k that you can burn right off the bat. $125,000 is the 25% down payment for a $500k house. Although if you want a slightly nicer home (like mine), you will need $175k. Let’s just say $200k, just so you can have some leftover money for emergency uses and other fees when purchasing a home. Where the hell are you going to get $200,000 right off the bat? I guess you can try winning the lottery, gambling at Vegas, or pray that your rich daddy will give you your inheritance soon enough.How much mortgage will you pay? That depends on how expensive the house is, but shopping around Zillow, it looks like the average monthly mortgage that most people seem to be paying in my town is about $3 to $4k per month. I would say that sounds fairly accurate. But before I factor this into your required income, we must not forget property taxes!Again, looking around Zillow, property taxes seem to range from $4.5k to over $6k per year. Again, to me, this seems fairly accurate. $4.5k (on the lower end) is about $375 per month. Oh, and don’t forget, since housing prices are on the rise in California, this will increase every year.And finally, you have home insurance. I don’t know how much most people pay for home insurance, but I would approximate about $1k per year. An extra $83 per month.Should I include utility bills here? Probably not, but keep in mind that both water and electricity are very expensive. Water is expensive because California is in a drought, and you’ll need lots of it to keep your lawn green; and electricity, because it’s hotter than hell (LA is, SF is probably better) for at least 6 months of the year, you’ll need a/c. I won’t factor in the numbers, because your mileage will vary, but keep this in mind.From factoring the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, you will probably need to pay about $3458 per month on the lower end, and about $4583 on the higher end. Due to California’s high (income) taxes, cost of gas, and cost of having a car (CA is very dependent on cars, in case you didn’t know), all of which you need to factor in if you want to live here, you would probably need to make at least $7k to $10k per month… or a salary of $84k to $120k annual salary (before taxes). Oh, and don’t forget about the $200k lottery winnings from earlier to pay for the down payment! So you’ll need to win the lottery, PLUS be working full time as a senior software engineer, mid-level manager of a large firm, or a doctor. There you have it, easy peasy! Welcome to California! Of course, over time, your property taxes will increase freakishly fast. We’ve had the house for about 20 years, and let me tell you… I’m not scared of the mortgage. If anything else, we can always refinance to get a lower rate. But the property tax? Holy shit! We don’t know how to stop this thing. It’s really spiraling out of control. I think by the time we pay off the house, the property taxes will cost as much as mortgage in a whole year (probably not that bad, but still…) At the end of the day… you might decide that your dream house in California is turning you into a wage slave. My ex-neighbor decided it wasn’t worth owning a house after his daughter left for college, so he sold it. He told me that 100% of all the prospective buyers were all wealthy, foreign (usually Chinese) nationals who had several million dollars in the bank. Not a single American-born prospective buyer ever came to his open house. In the end, he sold the house to a wealthy Taiwanese family, who used to own real estate in where the Taipei 101 is now (go figure). By doing so, he finally freed himself from the nightmare of property taxes… but of course, by selling the house to wealthy nationals, he just made the already unaffordable housing market even more unaffordable. Welp… good luck to you guys! I hope you enjoyed this joke answer, and have a Happy April Fool’s Day! (It’s still 4/1 where I am) Unless of course, you live in California like me. Then this is not an April Fool’s joke; it’s a reality that we have to deal with every day :(","California is a huge state. As such, housing prices varies depending on where you are. Obviously, housing will be cheaper in the middle of nowhere versus housing along the coastal cities. I’m assuming, though, that you are looking for a house in the suburban area of California, near LA, San Francisco, etc. I live in an upper middle-class neighborhood in LA’s suburb.

As such, housing prices varies depending on where you are. Obviously, housing will be cheaper in the middle of nowhere versus housing along the coastal cities. I’m assuming, though, that you are looking for a house in the suburban area of California, near LA, San Francisco, etc. I live in an upper middle-class neighborhood in LA’s suburb. My house, which is the cheapest one in the neighborhood (as per Zillow), is valued at around $700k. Now, granted, my neighborhood is in the upper middle class (but still nowhere near the most expensive). You can definitely find cheaper housing elsewhere in the LA metro area, but I seriously doubt you’re going to find anything cheaper than $500k. In fact, if you do find a house cheaper than $500k in Los Angeles, I would advise you to NOT purchase that home. Most likely, that house is either in the middle of Compton (very dangerous place), or it needs a lot of “tender loving care”. Now that we’ve established the approximate price range of housing that you’ll be looking at… let’s get started:You will need at least $125k that you can burn right off the bat. $125,000 is the 25% down payment for a $500k house. Although if you want a slightly nicer home (like mine), you will need $175k. Let’s just say $200k, just so you can have some leftover money for emergency uses and other fees when purchasing a home. Where the hell are you going to get $200,000 right off the bat? I guess you can try winning the lottery, gambling at Vegas, or pray that your rich daddy will give you your inheritance soon enough.How much mortgage will you pay? That depends on how expensive the house is, but shopping around Zillow, it looks like the average monthly mortgage that most people seem to be paying in my town is about $3 to $4k per month. I would say that sounds fairly accurate. But before I factor this into your required income, we must not forget property taxes!Again, looking around Zillow, property taxes seem to range from $4.5k to over $6k per year. Again, to me, this seems fairly accurate. $4.5k (on the lower end) is about $375 per month. Oh, and don’t forget, since housing prices are on the rise in California, this will increase every year.And finally, you have home insurance. I don’t know how much most people pay for home insurance, but I would approximate about $1k per year. An extra $83 per month.Should I include utility bills here? Probably not, but keep in mind that both water and electricity are very expensive. Water is expensive because California is in a drought, and you’ll need lots of it to keep your lawn green; and electricity, because it’s hotter than hell (LA is, SF is probably better) for at least 6 months of the year, you’ll need a/c. I won’t factor in the numbers, because your mileage will vary, but keep this in mind.From factoring the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, you will probably need to pay about $3458 per month on the lower end, and about $4583 on the higher end. Due to California’s high (income) taxes, cost of gas, and cost of having a car (CA is very dependent on cars, in case you didn’t know), all of which you need to factor in if you want to live here, you would probably need to make at least $7k to $10k per month… or a salary of $84k to $120k annual salary (before taxes). Oh, and don’t forget about the $200k lottery winnings from earlier to pay for the down payment! So you’ll need to win the lottery, PLUS be working full time as a senior software engineer, mid-level manager of a large firm, or a doctor. There you have it, easy peasy! Welcome to California! Of course, over time, your property taxes will increase freakishly fast. We’ve had the house for about 20 years, and let me tell you… I’m not scared of the mortgage. If anything else, we can always refinance to get a lower rate. But the property tax? Holy shit! We don’t know how to stop this thing. It’s really spiraling out of control. I think by the time we pay off the house, the property taxes will cost as much as mortgage in a whole year (probably not that bad, but still…) At the end of the day… you might decide that your dream house in California is turning you into a wage slave.

The same floorplan with an ocean view but not oceanfront will be 20–30% less. Without the view, but in the same complex, subtract another 25%. Taxes are ~1.25% of purchase price. A million-dollar condo bought today would pay about $12,000 annually in property taxes. An identical unit bought in the ‘90’s for $200,000 would still be paying $2400. HOA fees can be different by 10x. A small unit without a lot of landscaping might be $200/month. A downtown high-rise with concierge and many amenities can push $2000/month. Electricity costs can be very high. Thanks to all that “free” wind and solar power - and to utilities as social policy - rates can be ~38cents/kWh. Coastal areas won’t need much A/C but inland areas (even a few miles) will need a lot of it. Oddly enough, desert nights can be cool. Many Californians run their A/C’s indoors during the day but run outdoor heaters in the evening for their patios. Property values are specific not only to towns but even to neighborhoods. Parts of some major cities are not for the faint of heart. Property values in sketchy neighborhoods are much, much less than in nicer parts. The only way to know for sure is to do a lot of research. Much can be done online, but the best information is had by personal on-site inspection.","alifornia is about 900 miles North to South and 250 miles East to West.

Here’s how you do it: 1. Protect your computer against future malware infections Installing a malware removal tool on your computer is one of the best ways to prevent future malware infections and remove existing ones. A malware removal tool is a program that is designed to scan a computer for malware and remove it. There are many malware removal extensions for Chrome but the one we recommend is Guardio. Full disclaimer, this is our Chrome extension. Guardio is an anti-malware program that removes existing malware from your computer and prevents new malware infections. It does this by blocking harmful sites, extensions, and push notification providers that try to insert malware on your computer. Our dashboard provides you insights on your past activity like how many harmful websites, information leaks, suspicious websites, search hijackers, and intrusive pop-ups it has blocked.After you install Guardio on Chrome, it will automatically scan your computer to look for unwanted popups, information leaks, harmful apps, and to check your overall system health. If it finds a problem, it will automatically remove the malware source. Then it will work in the background to keep you safe while you browse through the internet. 2. Manually remove malware from your computer. Chrome has a feature that allows you to scan your computer for malware and remove it. It’s great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections. To start scanning your computer, all you have to do is visit your Chrome settings and at the bottom of the page, under “Advanced” you’ll find a section called, “Reset and clean up”.Click “Clean up computer” and then “Find” to start scanning your computer. After it finishes removing the malware it finds, you’ll be asked to restart your computer. Do it and you’ll have completed the process. Again, this process is great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections so add an extra layer of security to stay safe while browsing the internet. Install a malware removal tool like Guardio and have peace of mind in knowing that it will actively work to protect you.

Now that we have that covered, lets take it step-by-step and see where we end up. 1. Come up with an idea. That was easy, Kim Kardashian figurines. Obviously you recognized that the best business ideas are ones that are: understandable, executable, and that provide value to some market or group of customers. K-plushes follow pretty logically from this.  2. Come up with a name. K-Plush sounds pretty good, but we can do better. Hm. How about kPlush? No, thats dumb. There is probably a much better way to do this. How about stealing other peoples creativity and reaping all the benefits? Perfect! At this point you ask your friends, family, neighbors and alderman what they think the best name for a Kardashian-themed plush shop would be? After doing this, making a list, and sitting on it for a few days, you end up with K-Figs, which I personally think is a bit silly, but its not my company.  3. Incorporate. Now that K-Figs has a name, its time to protect yourself against nasty lawsuits. To do this you will go to Bizfilings (or Legalzoom) and get yourself a company. If you plan on taking outside investment, or hire a bunch of people to run your empire, your best choice is a Delaware C-Corp. If you just want to protect your assets, and you plan to keep the company small, a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) is probably good enough and will make your tax situation a lot easier. At this point you should stop listening to me on the subject and contact a lawyer.  4. Design the product. You would think that this part would be easy, K-Figs look like Kim Kardashian after all. What more could there be to it? Well just hold your horses good sir. Have you asked yourself what shes wearing? It seems like youll need at least a Winter Look and a Summer Look K-Fig, and youll probably need one for parties and for the beach. Thats four different items in your product mix that will speak to the tastes of different customer demographics. Since you realized the need for a strong product mix early on, you decide to spend a few days thinking up a few other different types of K-Figs that you can create that will target different elements of the Kardashian market.  5. Production. This is where things get a bit complicated. You have designed a half-dozen different plush figurines of Kim Kardashian and you dont know how you will get them made. Luckily you used the power of Google to find a few re-sellers that can create K-Figs from basic templates they already have in stock. They will even drop ship your product directly to your customer. This will save you an incredible amount of money compared to even your next best choice, outsourcing your manufacturing.  6. Build your team. Now that you have access to a product, you are going to need to build your storefront. To do this you will need to construct a team of other people who love K-Figs as much as you do, and who are willing to work for the unrealistic promise of future wealth (see: equity) rather than money. You are a savvy business-type-person so you have decided to keep your team small: you (who will handle the day-to-day business stuff), a technical co-founder (who will build the storefront), and a salesperson (whose job is to, well, sell).   7. Build your storefront. After a long talk with Janet, your technical co-founder, you have learned that you can, in fact, buy things on the Internet. To do so you need to make a website. There are a huge number of other parts to your website that you basically just leave to her to figure out, but what you can remember are: landing pages with clear calls to action, product pages with good descriptions of the K-Figs, a path to purchase that makes it easy to get from your landing page to checkout, social media buttons to start building a community, and a mailing list because email is a great way to reach out to customers before and after a sale.  She also starts talking about Javascript, MySQL, Ember.js, Sass, Haml, Ruby on Rails, Nginx, and a bunch of other stuff that you originally thought were specialty K-Figs, but then decided to look up a bit later and realized they were not.  8. Develop a marketing strategy. K-Figs arent just going to sell themselves, at least not until version 4.1.3 when they finally gain sentience. Until that day, youll need to do the legwork, which means marketing. Since you have no money and you really only know about K-Figs, you decide to keep it simple and develop a content strategy. Why? Content is free and you are versed in enough Kardashian Lore that you can easily turn out blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts to tell the world why K-Figs are a must have for any Kardashian fan. Remember the first rule of Content Club and that is to make things that people actually want to read, so be sure not to spend the entire time shilling your product. Instead, spend your entire time shilling Kim Kardashian and through her find an audience for your product.  9. Find distribution channels. Selling K-Figs on your website is cool and all, but where else should you be selling them? Gary, the sales dude, is pretty excited about affiliate marketing and reseller programs and thinks you should take a look at finding ways to get other people to sell K-Figs for you on commission. You promise that you will, but you dont because youre too busy seeing how to get K-Figs on Amazon, Etsy, and a half-dozen other more boutique online storefronts. Little do you know, this is exactly what Gary wanted all along.  10. Launch. You have a product, you have a website, you have a marketing strategy and you have outside distribution channels. Its finally time to launch! Before you show it to everyone you know, you should probably test your new business by showing it to a few people and asking them to provide you with some feedback. This should give you about three more weeks worth of iteration before you are actually able to launch, but now www [dot] k-figs-are-awesome [dot] com is even better than it was before so it was well worth it. While you are doing that iteration, someone emails you an article on On-Page SEO. You decide that it isnt another K-Fig suggestion and instead forward it to Janet, asking her to do some of the stuff written there. 11. Execute. K-Figs are in the wild. Now its time to execute on your marketing and sales strategy. What that means, as it turns out, is that you spend the next few months hating everything about all the work youve done because none of it is working and everyone hates you and life is terribly, brutally unfair. After a little while you get your first sale and everything is OK again.  12. Press time!  Now that you have a few sales under your belt, its time to really put some gas on the fire! Since you have neither gas nor a source of flames because youre still broke, you just decide to reach out to journalists instead and ask them whether they can talk about how cool your K-Figs are.

You also know that your outreach will be mostly ignored, so you prepare yourself for a few dozen followups at regular intervals. 13. Run the business.

Hope this helps!","Without an answer to what kind of business that you want to start, I am going to assume that you are going to build a online store that sells nothing but plush figurines of Kim Kardashian.  Now that we have that covered, lets take it step-by-step and see where we end up. 1. Come up with an idea. That was easy, Kim Kardashian figurines. Obviously you recognized that the best business ideas are ones that are: understandable, executable, and that provide value to some market or group of customers. K-plushes follow pretty logically from this.  2. Come up with a name.

Now that we have that covered, lets take it step-by-step and see where we end up. 1. Come up with an idea. That was easy, Kim Kardashian figurines. Obviously you recognized that the best business ideas are ones that are: understandable, executable, and that provide value to some market or group of customers. K-plushes follow pretty logically from this.  2. Come up with a name. K-Plush sounds pretty good, but we can do better. Hm. How about kPlush? No, thats dumb. There is probably a much better way to do this. How about stealing other peoples creativity and reaping all the benefits? Perfect! At this point you ask your friends, family, neighbors and alderman what they think the best name for a Kardashian-themed plush shop would be? After doing this, making a list, and sitting on it for a few days, you end up with K-Figs, which I personally think is a bit silly, but its not my company.  3. Incorporate. Now that K-Figs has a name, its time to protect yourself against nasty lawsuits. To do this you will go to Bizfilings (or Legalzoom) and get yourself a company. If you plan on taking outside investment, or hire a bunch of people to run your empire, your best choice is a Delaware C-Corp. If you just want to protect your assets, and you plan to keep the company small, a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) is probably good enough and will make your tax situation a lot easier. At this point you should stop listening to me on the subject and contact a lawyer.  4. Design the product. You would think that this part would be easy, K-Figs look like Kim Kardashian after all. What more could there be to it? Well just hold your horses good sir. Have you asked yourself what shes wearing? It seems like youll need at least a Winter Look and a Summer Look K-Fig, and youll probably need one for parties and for the beach. Thats four different items in your product mix that will speak to the tastes of different customer demographics. Since you realized the need for a strong product mix early on, you decide to spend a few days thinking up a few other different types of K-Figs that you can create that will target different elements of the Kardashian market.  5. Production. This is where things get a bit complicated. You have designed a half-dozen different plush figurines of Kim Kardashian and you dont know how you will get them made. Luckily you used the power of Google to find a few re-sellers that can create K-Figs from basic templates they already have in stock. They will even drop ship your product directly to your customer. This will save you an incredible amount of money compared to even your next best choice, outsourcing your manufacturing.  6. Build your team. Now that you have access to a product, you are going to need to build your storefront. To do this you will need to construct a team of other people who love K-Figs as much as you do, and who are willing to work for the unrealistic promise of future wealth (see: equity) rather than money. You are a savvy business-type-person so you have decided to keep your team small: you (who will handle the day-to-day business stuff), a technical co-founder (who will build the storefront), and a salesperson (whose job is to, well, sell).   7. Build your storefront. After a long talk with Janet, your technical co-founder, you have learned that you can, in fact, buy things on the Internet. To do so you need to make a website. There are a huge number of other parts to your website that you basically just leave to her to figure out, but what you can remember are: landing pages with clear calls to action, product pages with good descriptions of the K-Figs, a path to purchase that makes it easy to get from your landing page to checkout, social media buttons to start building a community, and a mailing list because email is a great way to reach out to customers before and after a sale.  She also starts talking about Javascript, MySQL, Ember.js, Sass, Haml, Ruby on Rails, Nginx, and a bunch of other stuff that you originally thought were specialty K-Figs, but then decided to look up a bit later and realized they were not.  8. Develop a marketing strategy. K-Figs arent just going to sell themselves, at least not until version 4.1.3 when they finally gain sentience. Until that day, youll need to do the legwork, which means marketing. Since you have no money and you really only know about K-Figs, you decide to keep it simple and develop a content strategy. Why? Content is free and you are versed in enough Kardashian Lore that you can easily turn out blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts to tell the world why K-Figs are a must have for any Kardashian fan. Remember the first rule of Content Club and that is to make things that people actually want to read, so be sure not to spend the entire time shilling your product. Instead, spend your entire time shilling Kim Kardashian and through her find an audience for your product.  9. Find distribution channels. Selling K-Figs on your website is cool and all, but where else should you be selling them? Gary, the sales dude, is pretty excited about affiliate marketing and reseller programs and thinks you should take a look at finding ways to get other people to sell K-Figs for you on commission. You promise that you will, but you dont because youre too busy seeing how to get K-Figs on Amazon, Etsy, and a half-dozen other more boutique online storefronts. Little do you know, this is exactly what Gary wanted all along.  10. Launch. You have a product, you have a website, you have a marketing strategy and you have outside distribution channels. Its finally time to launch! Before you show it to everyone you know, you should probably test your new business by showing it to a few people and asking them to provide you with some feedback. This should give you about three more weeks worth of iteration before you are actually able to launch, but now www [dot] k-figs-are-awesome [dot] com is even better than it was before so it was well worth it. While you are doing that iteration, someone emails you an article on On-Page SEO. You decide that it isnt another K-Fig suggestion and instead forward it to Janet, asking her to do some of the stuff written there. 11. Execute. K-Figs are in the wild. Now its time to execute on your marketing and sales strategy. What that means, as it turns out, is that you spend the next few months hating everything about all the work youve done because none of it is working and everyone hates you and life is terribly, brutally unfair. After a little while you get your first sale and everything is OK again.  12. Press time!  Now that you have a few sales under your belt, its time to really put some gas on the fire! Since you have neither gas nor a source of flames because youre still broke, you just decide to reach out to journalists instead and ask them whether they can talk about how cool your K-Figs are. Since these are online journalists you know that you should keep your missive: short, filled with exciting facts about why your product is awesome, filled with even more exciting facts about why writing your story makes sense to them. You also know that your outreach will be mostly ignored, so you prepare yourself for a few dozen followups at regular intervals. 13. Run the business.

Human population has never been 2.* To be fair, it made their math easier, and their philosophy too, on a half-serious experimental problem, but they took a pass on modeling any pre-Neolithic populations, on the grounds that it wouldnt make much of a difference anyway.   Even if they hadnt taken this pass, their numbers would be different. Both used benchmark years (e.g. 1750 had 795 million people, 1800 had 969 million people) and interpolate the growth in between by using the population growth equation [math]N(t)=N_0e^r^t[/math]. However, Haubs choice was to multiply the birth rate for each year times the population for each year and Ramseys was to use calculus to get the total number of person-years lived and divide by life expectancy.  Haubs number is much higher, even for just the last 2000 years (62 billion to Ramseys 48 billion, both updated to 2014), because it assumes a much greater number of infant deaths, especially in the early years. But this doesnt explain the long tail of the growth curve, not even visible on the chart below.  Wikimedia: El T (Public domain) Its not that there was no one around in the Paleolithic... the demographers have just taken a pass on an essential definition. What do we mean by human? Lets follow Ramseys method back to a few possibilities, all of them arbitrary of course. If we update to 2013, using a life expectancy of 60, Ramseys method gives 97.5 billion, but 19.6 billion of these are in the -1,000,000 to -9,000 period. Lets work with 97.5 billion - 19.6 billion = 77.9 billion since 9000 BCE, when agriculture was really starting to lift populations in small regions of the world.  If we start with human effective population size and accept a very high estimate of the Toba bottleneck [Ambrose-PDF], i.e. 10,000 reproductive females (Takahata et al., 1995; Klein et al., 1993;Erlich et al., 1996; Sherry et al., 1997). the total population in -71,000 could have been something like 30,000. According to Ramsey, the total person-years from A to B is [P(B)-P(A)](B-A)/{Ln[P(B)]-Ln[P(A)]}.  So ((7,500,000-30,000)(-9000-(-71000)))/{ln(7,500,000)-ln(30,000)} gives 83.9 billion person-years. Divide by a life expectancy of 25 and get 3.4 billion. So with an updated Ramsey, we get 81.3 billion since Toba (ca. 73,000 years ago), which works with the timescale of behavioral modernity, if you believe in that sort of thing. Does this include our Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors, and other Homo lineages throughout Africa and Eurasia weve not yet encountered? It gets messy from here. Without doing Haubs interpolations, but instead allowing for what his birth rate method does: push the life expectancy down to ~16, we can add to Haubs 107 billion since 8,000 BCE. and 5.2 billion from then back to Toba. That gives 112 billion and counting. Yes, not too much of a difference from the handwave, but you can take this calculation back to human-chimpanzee divergence if youre willing to keep guessing on population sizes. Do we reach a trillion hominoids?The significance is that both numbers are enormous. They are enormous largely because most of the people who have ever lived never became adults. Haub answered the question to address the common saying (incorrect) that more people are alive today than have ever lived (we are at about 7% given his assumptions), but if were just counting adults over 15, there are 4.4 billion alive today, which might be a fifth of the adults whove lived in the last 2,000 years.

Im a doctor, so this is not going to be a herbal/homemade/ayurvedic/ natural remedies answer. Further this is based on my own struggle with acne a few years back and my training at medical school. Summary : A good consistent skincare with the right ingredients is one of the key steps to prevent acne. For already existent acne, using the correct drugs would help in faster resolution with minimal damage to skin.Disclaimer: This is not intended to provide diagnosis/treatment without supervision under a registered medical practitioner.Acne is a multifactorial chronic skin condition that starts around the time one attains puberty. A person with flawless skin might suddenly find herself/himself with blemishes in their teens and I know how annoying that gets, especially when someone says - “It is normal to have acne, ignore it!” The dermatologist I would go to throughout my school life put me on doxycycline tablets (antibiotics) every alternate month for two weeks and topical adapalene (which he never taught me how to apply correctly). As a result, my skin never cleared completely. Antibiotics will not help with long term management of acne. And doxycycline,if taken for too long, causes gastric discomfort.When I started my second year at college and had my first dermatology posting, I wanted to get to the bottom of things. I was tired of random breakouts out of nowhere. This is how my acne lesions looked back during my second year of college :I had the papulo-pustular kind of lesions, with one or two nodules. The most severe variant of acne is the nodulo-cystic variant that has the highest potential for scarring. The mildest form of acne are comedones which may be open or closed and they do not leave any residual discolouration / scarring. The first thing I did was to talk to the dermatology department at college and get a prescription for low dose isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is a schedule H, category X drug. It must only be taken under supervision. I was initially afraid of starting isotretinoin because everyone only spoke about the possible side effects of the drug. Nobody highlighted the benefits. Nonetheless, I went ahead with it. I customized my own regime after a point of time when I was sure about how my skin was responding. This is not to be tried by others, unless theyre doctors. I repeat, isotretinoin must be taken only under medical supervision. One needs to monitor their liver function test and lipid profile while on the drug. And married/sexually active women are needed to use an effective method of contraception during the whole period. Isotretinoin dries the skin and lips. Flaking of lips is one of the earliest visible signs that isotretinoin has attained concentration in skin. I took isotretinoin for around 3 months, during which I tapered the dose from 20mg to 5mg. This is how my skin looked at the end of 3 months:During the period, I was on isotretinoin, I only used a sunscreen, a mild cleanser and an oil free moisturizer on my skin. I did not use any topical treatment simultaneously.Thereafter, the real battle against acne started. The purpose of taking isotretinoin was to supress the already present acne and downregulate the hyperactive sebaceous glands for the time being. Effects are not permanent but are longer lasting than doxycycline. Also, I did not experience any intolerable or dangerous side effects from the drug. Low dose isotretinoin is a pretty safe drug (as per my own experience and a whole lot of articles available online on ncbi, pubmed and other websites). The most important part of acne skin care is a sunscreen. I use an oil free, matte finish spf 50, PA+++ sunscreen religiously (UV DOUX by Brinton pharmaceuticals). Apart from sunscreen, I also make it a point to cover my face if Im out in the sun and limit my sun exposure as much as possible.It looks funny. But it is worth it. (This is how I looked during field visits in my Community medicine posting at college, too!).Ill go step-wise now. Step 1: A gentle, mild, preferably a fragrance and colour free cleanser. Vigorous scrubbing of skin, cleaning skin multiple times, using a harsh cleanser and using too many cleansers will not help. Dirt does not cause acne, so over cleaning will not have any added benefit. The purpose of using a mild cleanser is to remove the accumulated dirt from skin surface and prepare skin for the next step. Using a mild cleanser does not strip the skin off its natural barrier and in turn, does not stimulate excess oil production. I use two : the cetaphil gentle exfoliating cleanser (twice a day, daily) and the Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser (on days my skin feels sensitive).Step 2: I use sunscreen during daytime.At night, I use a colourless, fragrance free gel as a serum ( Clinique dramatically different hydrating jelly) which is to provide an added layer of moisture to my skin.This is not a mandatory step, I use it just for added layer of moisturizer because keeping the skin moisturized and supple is a key step to prevent skin inflammation and acne. Moisturizing skin DOES NOT cause acne. I do not use any alcohol based toner. Step 3: During the daytime, I use a dab of non-comedogenic setting powder to give a matte finish (Revlon Colorstay pressed powder). I do not use any foundation / concealer / bronze/ blush, etc on my skin.At night, I use a good moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated. Ive two, one for summer and one for winter. Both are fragrance free, colour free and non-comedogenic.This is the basic skin-care skeleton.Additionally, there are a few products that I use much less frequently because too much of those have the potential to irritate the skin and my skin doesnt tolerate them on a day to day basis.Retinol : Revibra a15 by Dr Reddy. This comes as a capsule that has the active ingredient Retinol which is applied to the entire face in a thin layer after washing the face. After 10–15 minutes, it has to be followed with a moisturizer. Nothing else should be used on the skin alongside retinol. Retinol is a retinoic acid derivative that sort of “remodels” the skin. It helps with acne and at the same time, it prevents wrinkles from forming in future.Vit C capsules by Dr Reddy (Revibra c-10). Ascorbic acid is a potent anti-oxidant that fights against free radical damage and also has a proven role in hyperpigmentation, especially sun induced skin pigmentation. This is also a skin irritant and I use it just once a week. My mother tolerates both retinol and vit C better, so she uses them on alternate nights. This has to be customised as per ones skin tolerability. This also helps to fade acne hyperpigmentation.The acne treatment drugs (topical) - Ive experimented with all the anti acne topical drugs and the two which seem to have the highest tolerability by my sensitive skin are :Adapalene (again a retinoic acid derivative). It has to be applied as a very thin single layer over the entire skin area and not dabbed as blebs on just the acne. Adapalene and retinol should NEVER be used concomitantly. Whenever there is active acne, Adapalene alone is sufficient. I use the deriva cms gel which is a combination of Adapalene with clindamycin (antibiotic).Nadifloxacin : For pustules, this works well. It is less irritating than clindamycin on my sensitive skin.When there is active acne, these drugs have to be given sufficient time to work. They do not work overnight. Benzoyl peroxide irritates my skin and Im not a fan of the drug. Salicylic acid and glycolic acid wipes available as Acnepads in India come in the form of pre-soaked skin pads. They can be used once a while to chemically exfoliate the skin. I do not use a face scrub for exfoliation. Another salicylic acid containing product is the innisfree bija mask that can be used once a week and left on for 15–20 minutes.The Body shop tea tree night mask contains tea tree and salicylic acid. It can be used weekly overnight (I use it on top of a moisturizer to prevent drying)All the products Ive mentioned are extremely mild and should ideally not cause any issues to sensitive skin but I still advise a face to face consultation with a doctor to avoid any unwanted effects. (The innisfree aloe gel is a mild soothing gel that can be used on face after sun exposure. It is not a mandatory component of acne care)Post acne skin care:- Acne erythema: I did not do anything specifically for erythema. Once the acne is more under control, the erythema fades over a period of few months,provided the skin is not tampered with. One new product that Ive recently incorporated in my skin care is the Avéne thermal spring water. My brother calls it tube-well water! But, there are a few articles I came across online that have spoken about the benefits of thermal spring water in management of skin inflammation. Im still in the experimental phase with this.Acne hyperpigmentation: Just like erythema, hyperpigmentation starts to fade when acne is in control. Additionally, sun protection and using something like Vit C or Kojic Acid on affected areas will help. This needs patience but it will eventually go away.Acne scars: This is the most difficult to treat. It needs in patient visits with a dermatologist. Topical therapy will not be 100% effective. Scars are dents on the skin surface left over by nodulo-cystic acne (most commonly) or if someone scratches / squeezes any other kind of acne. The golden saying: do not touch your face except during skin care!Lifestyle changes:It is not proven that oily food causes acne. However, Ive noticed that during periods of stress, when I crave junk, my skin tends to have mild breakouts. Avoiding refined sugar, high fat foods and processed food is beneficial for the overall health in the long term and I feel they do help in achieving clear skin.Changing pillow cover every alternate day because the face tends to touch the pillow at night.Using an anti-dandruff shampoo (active ingredients : Ketoconazole, salicylic acid, ciclopirox, ZPTO). Those with acne tend to have oily scalps too which is a perfect habitat for the lipophilic fungus Malassezia.A general healthy lifestyle (avoid smoking, drinking), stay active and happy. Ive noticed acne worsening and popping out of nowhere when Im unhappy and frustrated (before every exam!).I avoid milk and milk products (except Epigamia plain yogurt which is a fermented product). In a lot of people, milk is known to trigger breakouts.A lot of antioxidants in diet. I have a minimum of 2 fruits everyday and a whole lot of colourful vegetables. My diet is incomplete without fruits and vegetables, every single day.And finally, be gentle to and love your skin. Itll repay you back when youre older 😃. Good skin in 50s and beyond is definitely something to die for! (I look at it that way 🙄)￼Tips for choosing the correct skincare products:Look for products that are fragrance free and colour free. Colour, fragrance are unnecessary additives that have no role in skin care.There is a website called cosdna which gives a summary of different ingredients in a product and their purpose. I use it to identify potential comedogenic ingredients in products that I buy.Avoid highly foaming cleansers, they strip off all the oil from face and in turn, stimuli the sebaceous glands to become hyperactive.Scrubbing with a highly exfoliating scrub does not help. Id advise to avoid it.While choosing a moisturizer for face, look for good ingredients like these :Pic: Im not fond of putting solo pictures online but this just to show that acne is something a lot of us struggle with and a good lifestyle alongside good skincare will go a long way in keeping it under control. This was taken at the end of 3rd year, in natural light and no foundation / concealer on skin. Hope that helps! 🙂","I had decided to write on this topic long back, after I have a grip over my own skin issues.

Up to 85% of people will suffer from pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, cysts or pustules. Some grow out of it, but not all; acne is the most common skin condition and affects millions of Indians annually. To be honest…acne is more than an inconvenience.

It can cause both physical and psychological problems including permanent scarring of the skin, poor self-image, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. However, let me tell you... THERE IS NO QUICK FIX TO ACNE! There...band-aid ripped off! The path to clear skin is often one of trial and error; you might need to try several acne remedies before you find the right treatment for the types of acne affecting your skin. Before trying acne medication, you may prefer to give different natural acne treatment options a chance. While theres no research supporting the effective use of natural acne treatments, here are two popular options that you may want to try. 1. Coconut Oil Coconut oil is all the rage, with uses ranging from hair conditioning to cooking. But some swear by it as a natural acne treatment. To use coconut oil as an acne treatment, you can include it as part of a healthy diet. Or, you can apply a very small amount and rub directly onto your skin after cleansing for an extra hydrating boost. 2. Tea Tree Oil Some people swear by the disinfecting power of tea tree oil for acne treatment. It can be applied either full strength or slightly diluted with water directly onto pimples. Use a small amount on a clean cotton swab or cotton pad and dab on the affected areas immediately after cleansing. Because tea tree oil can be drying, you might choose to use both tea tree oil and coconut oil for acne as part of your clear skin regimen. Disclaimer: While the home remedies may not be enough to give you clear skin, especially in those with complicated, inflammatory cystic acne. There are several acne medication options approved for use, but which one is best for you is a question for your dermatologist. Here are a few of the acne treatments you can consider:Acne Control Protocol (For Active Acne and Acne Pigmentation)A combination of personalized medical treatment and fortnightly cleanup sessions for 3 months takes care of active acne and reddish brown acne pigmentation. Severe acne may need a Comedone buster, like a ‘Carbon peel’ which is the latest addition to the treatment protocol.Acne Scar ProtocolWe have the world’s most effective Ultrapulse Total FX laser technology for acne scars. Unlike most skin treatments that require repeated appointments to achieve optimal results, the Ultrapulse Total FX laser treatment reduces the appearance of wrinkles, and scars. We understand how much acne can affect your life and especially your self-confidence.

Blackheads are the result of dead skin cells, oil and bacteria building up and clogging the pores; since we all have dead cells, oil and bacteria on our skin -it’s bound to happen. That said, in order to get rid of blackheads you’d need to book a mechanical extraction with a professional aesthetician.

I wouldn’t advise you to “do it yourself” because let’s be honest, most people just end up butchering their skin. If you’re thinking, what about prevention? What can be done in order to get LESS blackheads? I have got you covered. You can prevent blackheads by using skincare products formulated with salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and dioic acid. Here’s how they work. Salycilic acid breaks down the materials that clog the pores. You might have heard of this ingredient as the #1 ally for those who have an oily skin type. The product must be leave-on and applied every single day. Remember to limit the application on the nose or wherever you get the comedones! Glycolic acid removes the skin’s top layer, unclogging follicles. While this might sound scary, the top layer of the skin is actually made of dead skin cells. You can see this answer for more on the structure of the epidermis:You should use your glycolic acid exfoliant three times a week. If your skin can’t tolerate glycolic acid you can use another AHA. Dioic acid reduces sebum. This ingredient is not quite as popular or well known as the two that i mentioned before. If you’ve never heard of it before, I am glad I was the one to introduce it to you. (It’s a pretty good hyperpigmentation ingredient, too.) Finally, in order to reduce the amount of blackheads you get remember to wash your face with a cleanser every day, possibly when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Don’t sleep on a dirty pillow cover and make sure you always have a clean face mask to wear before you go out. Hope this helps!","Please note that it’s impossible to eliminate blackheads forever.

Me : So that I can give you a cookie-cutter answer to your question. According to Hinduism, the purpose of life is four-fold: to achieve Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. Dharma, means to act morally and ethically throughout one’s life. Artha refers to the pursuit of wealth and prosperity in one’Continue ReadingYou : What is the real aim of human like? Me : Well, why do you ask? You : Thats the most important question isnt it? Why are we here after all? Me : It most certainly is. But before I answer, tell me, do you believe in religion? You : Umm, well, I am a Hindu, but whats that got to do with this question? Me : So that I can give you a cookie-cutter answer to your question. According to Hinduism, the purpose of life is four-fold: to achieve Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. Dharma, means to act morally and ethically throughout one’s life. Artha refers to the pursuit of wealth and prosperity in one’s life. Kama means to seek and obtain enjoyment from life. And the fourth Moksha means enlightenment. Moksha may take an individual just one lifetime to accomplish (rarely) or it may take several.  You : Yes, yes, I know all these, but I want something different, something that satisfies me. And what if I wasnt a Hindu, my aim changes then? Me : Well, thats essentially what religions are for. They give meaning to our life, no matter what religion it is. What is hard for you to believe is that you were just put on this giant rock of a planet to just live and to just leave your legacy for future generations once you die. You : Hmm, I think so. So, if I am finally going to die and we all know theres no escaping from death, what am I doing here, and since death is the final outcome, why not reach there as soon as possible? Me : So commit suicide? You : You certainly have a way of hitting the bulls eye. Yeah, why not that man? Me : And miss out on all the adventures, dreams, laughs and plethora of emotions youre going to experience with your fellow beings.  Miss out on that first kiss that makes you feel like something bad inside you melted in an exquisite way. Miss out on the bright sunshine that creeps through your window on a cold day; and a cool breeze that combs your hair when the day is warm. Miss out on the jittery feeling youll get when you propose to someone that truly matters. Miss out on watching the sun rise over the towering Himalayas, getting lost in the wild Amazon forests, and diving in the crystal clear blue waters in Maldives. Miss out on the look of satisfaction on a mothers face when she feeds her son after he returns from school. Miss out on a fathers applause when he watches her daughter come to the stage to receive her graduation degree.  Miss out on exploding crackers on Diwali with friends and tasting that crumbly-moist cake on Christmas.Me : That...that sounds so beautiful. But, but, is this all life has to offer? Nothing else? Nothing grand? You : My friend, this is grand. Look at the world around you. Look at the beauty which has been deliberately placed there for you to experience. Swim in the moment. Dont look for the next big thing, the next relationship, the next job or the next adventure. When that happens, it will happen. But today, your purpose is to live in all your glory. Let the moment seize you. Let it capture you so fascinatingly that you lose yourself in the beauty thats been placed around you. Me : I understand all that Buddhist monk stuff. Live in the moment. Live in the now. I also read a couple of books, but I couldnt really find something definite? You : You were seeking something, looking for an outlet, a clue, a goal maybe. Me : Yes, so what. Thats not wrong, is it? I want a goal in my life. You : Absolutely. Theres nothing wrong in that. You see, a goal isnt your destination....its a direction to travel in. Its something to get you moving, somewhere, anywhere, just as long as you arent stagnant. I know this isnt the usual way to think of goals, but its a much more useful way to think of them. But remember, youre asking life to give you a goal that is life-changing and eternal. But nothing is eternal. Nothing is, nothing was and nothing will be. All that is eternal is you in the now. So when you think of a goal or an idea worth pursuing, give it a go. Dont sit there and try to think up something youll be good at and youll enjoy doing for the rest of your life. Very few people can correctly figure that out. Instead, pick something that sounds interesting to you and just go for it. Does being a designer sound interesting to you? Go practice drawing. If you like it, keep going, and a few years from now, youll find yourself doing something thats only marginally related to that, but uses the skills you learned from practicing in ways you never imagined. For all I know, youll be designing covers for National Geographic.  Dont like doing that? Thats alright. Its okay. Just pick something else that sounds interesting. Maybe teaching kids? Maybe youll end up making videos like Salman Khan from Khan Academy.  Or not. Point being, ultimately it doesnt matter what your goal is, it only matters that it interests you, and gives you joy enough to make you move. Thats all you need to do: move. You : Hmm. So, and correct me if Im wrong, the purpose of life is to just be and to authentically explore whatever it is that gives me joy?  Me : Well I always knew you were pretty smart.  You : (Stares outside) Hey look, the suns going down creating a mix of orange-blue palette in the sky and the moon is rising slowly, almost shyly. Thats just enchantingly beautiful.

Im a doctor, so this is not going to be a herbal/homemade/ayurvedic/ natural remedies answer. Further this is based on my own struggle with acne a few years back and my training at medical school. Summary : A good consistent skincare with the right ingredients is one of the key steps to prevent acne. For already existent acne, using the correct drugs would help in faster resolution with minimal damage to skin.Disclaimer: This is not intended to provide diagnosis/treatment without supervision under a registered medical practitioner.Acne is a multifactorial chronic skin condition that starts around the time one attains puberty. A person with flawless skin might suddenly find herself/himself with blemishes in their teens and I know how annoying that gets, especially when someone says - “It is normal to have acne, ignore it!” The dermatologist I would go to throughout my school life put me on doxycycline tablets (antibiotics) every alternate month for two weeks and topical adapalene (which he never taught me how to apply correctly). As a result, my skin never cleared completely. Antibiotics will not help with long term management of acne. And doxycycline,if taken for too long, causes gastric discomfort.When I started my second year at college and had my first dermatology posting, I wanted to get to the bottom of things. I was tired of random breakouts out of nowhere. This is how my acne lesions looked back during my second year of college :I had the papulo-pustular kind of lesions, with one or two nodules. The most severe variant of acne is the nodulo-cystic variant that has the highest potential for scarring. The mildest form of acne are comedones which may be open or closed and they do not leave any residual discolouration / scarring. The first thing I did was to talk to the dermatology department at college and get a prescription for low dose isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is a schedule H, category X drug. It must only be taken under supervision. I was initially afraid of starting isotretinoin because everyone only spoke about the possible side effects of the drug. Nobody highlighted the benefits. Nonetheless, I went ahead with it. I customized my own regime after a point of time when I was sure about how my skin was responding. This is not to be tried by others, unless theyre doctors. I repeat, isotretinoin must be taken only under medical supervision. One needs to monitor their liver function test and lipid profile while on the drug. And married/sexually active women are needed to use an effective method of contraception during the whole period. Isotretinoin dries the skin and lips. Flaking of lips is one of the earliest visible signs that isotretinoin has attained concentration in skin. I took isotretinoin for around 3 months, during which I tapered the dose from 20mg to 5mg. This is how my skin looked at the end of 3 months:During the period, I was on isotretinoin, I only used a sunscreen, a mild cleanser and an oil free moisturizer on my skin. I did not use any topical treatment simultaneously.Thereafter, the real battle against acne started. The purpose of taking isotretinoin was to supress the already present acne and downregulate the hyperactive sebaceous glands for the time being. Effects are not permanent but are longer lasting than doxycycline. Also, I did not experience any intolerable or dangerous side effects from the drug. Low dose isotretinoin is a pretty safe drug (as per my own experience and a whole lot of articles available online on ncbi, pubmed and other websites). The most important part of acne skin care is a sunscreen. I use an oil free, matte finish spf 50, PA+++ sunscreen religiously (UV DOUX by Brinton pharmaceuticals). Apart from sunscreen, I also make it a point to cover my face if Im out in the sun and limit my sun exposure as much as possible.It looks funny. But it is worth it. (This is how I looked during field visits in my Community medicine posting at college, too!).Ill go step-wise now. Step 1: A gentle, mild, preferably a fragrance and colour free cleanser. Vigorous scrubbing of skin, cleaning skin multiple times, using a harsh cleanser and using too many cleansers will not help. Dirt does not cause acne, so over cleaning will not have any added benefit. The purpose of using a mild cleanser is to remove the accumulated dirt from skin surface and prepare skin for the next step. Using a mild cleanser does not strip the skin off its natural barrier and in turn, does not stimulate excess oil production. I use two : the cetaphil gentle exfoliating cleanser (twice a day, daily) and the Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser (on days my skin feels sensitive).Step 2: I use sunscreen during daytime.At night, I use a colourless, fragrance free gel as a serum ( Clinique dramatically different hydrating jelly) which is to provide an added layer of moisture to my skin.This is not a mandatory step, I use it just for added layer of moisturizer because keeping the skin moisturized and supple is a key step to prevent skin inflammation and acne. Moisturizing skin DOES NOT cause acne. I do not use any alcohol based toner. Step 3: During the daytime, I use a dab of non-comedogenic setting powder to give a matte finish (Revlon Colorstay pressed powder). I do not use any foundation / concealer / bronze/ blush, etc on my skin.At night, I use a good moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated. Ive two, one for summer and one for winter. Both are fragrance free, colour free and non-comedogenic.This is the basic skin-care skeleton.Additionally, there are a few products that I use much less frequently because too much of those have the potential to irritate the skin and my skin doesnt tolerate them on a day to day basis.Retinol : Revibra a15 by Dr Reddy. This comes as a capsule that has the active ingredient Retinol which is applied to the entire face in a thin layer after washing the face. After 10–15 minutes, it has to be followed with a moisturizer. Nothing else should be used on the skin alongside retinol. Retinol is a retinoic acid derivative that sort of “remodels” the skin. It helps with acne and at the same time, it prevents wrinkles from forming in future.Vit C capsules by Dr Reddy (Revibra c-10). Ascorbic acid is a potent anti-oxidant that fights against free radical damage and also has a proven role in hyperpigmentation, especially sun induced skin pigmentation. This is also a skin irritant and I use it just once a week. My mother tolerates both retinol and vit C better, so she uses them on alternate nights. This has to be customised as per ones skin tolerability. This also helps to fade acne hyperpigmentation.The acne treatment drugs (topical) - Ive experimented with all the anti acne topical drugs and the two which seem to have the highest tolerability by my sensitive skin are :Adapalene (again a retinoic acid derivative). It has to be applied as a very thin single layer over the entire skin area and not dabbed as blebs on just the acne. Adapalene and retinol should NEVER be used concomitantly. Whenever there is active acne, Adapalene alone is sufficient. I use the deriva cms gel which is a combination of Adapalene with clindamycin (antibiotic).Nadifloxacin : For pustules, this works well. It is less irritating than clindamycin on my sensitive skin.When there is active acne, these drugs have to be given sufficient time to work. They do not work overnight. Benzoyl peroxide irritates my skin and Im not a fan of the drug. Salicylic acid and glycolic acid wipes available as Acnepads in India come in the form of pre-soaked skin pads. They can be used once a while to chemically exfoliate the skin. I do not use a face scrub for exfoliation. Another salicylic acid containing product is the innisfree bija mask that can be used once a week and left on for 15–20 minutes.The Body shop tea tree night mask contains tea tree and salicylic acid. It can be used weekly overnight (I use it on top of a moisturizer to prevent drying)All the products Ive mentioned are extremely mild and should ideally not cause any issues to sensitive skin but I still advise a face to face consultation with a doctor to avoid any unwanted effects. (The innisfree aloe gel is a mild soothing gel that can be used on face after sun exposure. It is not a mandatory component of acne care)Post acne skin care:- Acne erythema: I did not do anything specifically for erythema. Once the acne is more under control, the erythema fades over a period of few months,provided the skin is not tampered with. One new product that Ive recently incorporated in my skin care is the Avéne thermal spring water. My brother calls it tube-well water! But, there are a few articles I came across online that have spoken about the benefits of thermal spring water in management of skin inflammation. Im still in the experimental phase with this.Acne hyperpigmentation: Just like erythema, hyperpigmentation starts to fade when acne is in control. Additionally, sun protection and using something like Vit C or Kojic Acid on affected areas will help. This needs patience but it will eventually go away.Acne scars: This is the most difficult to treat. It needs in patient visits with a dermatologist. Topical therapy will not be 100% effective. Scars are dents on the skin surface left over by nodulo-cystic acne (most commonly) or if someone scratches / squeezes any other kind of acne. The golden saying: do not touch your face except during skin care!Lifestyle changes:It is not proven that oily food causes acne. However, Ive noticed that during periods of stress, when I crave junk, my skin tends to have mild breakouts. Avoiding refined sugar, high fat foods and processed food is beneficial for the overall health in the long term and I feel they do help in achieving clear skin.Changing pillow cover every alternate day because the face tends to touch the pillow at night.Using an anti-dandruff shampoo (active ingredients : Ketoconazole, salicylic acid, ciclopirox, ZPTO). Those with acne tend to have oily scalps too which is a perfect habitat for the lipophilic fungus Malassezia.A general healthy lifestyle (avoid smoking, drinking), stay active and happy. Ive noticed acne worsening and popping out of nowhere when Im unhappy and frustrated (before every exam!).I avoid milk and milk products (except Epigamia plain yogurt which is a fermented product). In a lot of people, milk is known to trigger breakouts.A lot of antioxidants in diet. I have a minimum of 2 fruits everyday and a whole lot of colourful vegetables. My diet is incomplete without fruits and vegetables, every single day.And finally, be gentle to and love your skin. Itll repay you back when youre older 😃. Good skin in 50s and beyond is definitely something to die for! (I look at it that way 🙄)￼Tips for choosing the correct skincare products:Look for products that are fragrance free and colour free. Colour, fragrance are unnecessary additives that have no role in skin care.There is a website called cosdna which gives a summary of different ingredients in a product and their purpose. I use it to identify potential comedogenic ingredients in products that I buy.Avoid highly foaming cleansers, they strip off all the oil from face and in turn, stimuli the sebaceous glands to become hyperactive.Scrubbing with a highly exfoliating scrub does not help. Id advise to avoid it.While choosing a moisturizer for face, look for good ingredients like these :Pic: Im not fond of putting solo pictures online but this just to show that acne is something a lot of us struggle with and a good lifestyle alongside good skincare will go a long way in keeping it under control. This was taken at the end of 3rd year, in natural light and no foundation / concealer on skin. Hope that helps! 🙂","I had decided to write on this topic long back, after I have a grip over my own skin issues.

The mildest form of acne are comedones which may be open or closed and they do not leave any residual discolouration / scarring. The first thing I did was to talk to the dermatology department at college and get a prescription for low dose isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is a schedule H, category X drug. It must only be taken under supervision. I was initially afraid of starting isotretinoin because everyone only spoke about the possible side effects of the drug. Nobody highlighted the benefits. Nonetheless, I went ahead with it. I customized my own regime after a point of time when I was sure about how my skin was responding. This is not to be tried by others, unless theyre doctors. I repeat, isotretinoin must be taken only under medical supervision. One needs to monitor their liver function test and lipid profile while on the drug. And married/sexually active women are needed to use an effective method of contraception during the whole period. Isotretinoin dries the skin and lips. Flaking of lips is one of the earliest visible signs that isotretinoin has attained concentration in skin. I took isotretinoin for around 3 months, during which I tapered the dose from 20mg to 5mg. This is how my skin looked at the end of 3 months:During the period, I was on isotretinoin, I only used a sunscreen, a mild cleanser and an oil free moisturizer on my skin. I did not use any topical treatment simultaneously.Thereafter, the real battle against acne started. The purpose of taking isotretinoin was to supress the already present acne and downregulate the hyperactive sebaceous glands for the time being. Effects are not permanent but are longer lasting than doxycycline. Also, I did not experience any intolerable or dangerous side effects from the drug. Low dose isotretinoin is a pretty safe drug (as per my own experience and a whole lot of articles available online on ncbi, pubmed and other websites). The most important part of acne skin care is a sunscreen. I use an oil free, matte finish spf 50, PA+++ sunscreen religiously (UV DOUX by Brinton pharmaceuticals). Apart from sunscreen, I also make it a point to cover my face if Im out in the sun and limit my sun exposure as much as possible.It looks funny. But it is worth it. (This is how I looked during field visits in my Community medicine posting at college, too!).Ill go step-wise now. Step 1: A gentle, mild, preferably a fragrance and colour free cleanser. Vigorous scrubbing of skin, cleaning skin multiple times, using a harsh cleanser and using too many cleansers will not help. Dirt does not cause acne, so over cleaning will not have any added benefit. The purpose of using a mild cleanser is to remove the accumulated dirt from skin surface and prepare skin for the next step. Using a mild cleanser does not strip the skin off its natural barrier and in turn, does not stimulate excess oil production. I use two : the cetaphil gentle exfoliating cleanser (twice a day, daily) and the Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser (on days my skin feels sensitive).Step 2: I use sunscreen during daytime.At night, I use a colourless, fragrance free gel as a serum ( Clinique dramatically different hydrating jelly) which is to provide an added layer of moisture to my skin.This is not a mandatory step, I use it just for added layer of moisturizer because keeping the skin moisturized and supple is a key step to prevent skin inflammation and acne. Moisturizing skin DOES NOT cause acne. I do not use any alcohol based toner. Step 3: During the daytime, I use a dab of non-comedogenic setting powder to give a matte finish (Revlon Colorstay pressed powder). I do not use any foundation / concealer / bronze/ blush, etc on my skin.At night, I use a good moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated. Ive two, one for summer and one for winter. Both are fragrance free, colour free and non-comedogenic.This is the basic skin-care skeleton.Additionally, there are a few products that I use much less frequently because too much of those have the potential to irritate the skin and my skin doesnt tolerate them on a day to day basis.Retinol : Revibra a15 by Dr Reddy. This comes as a capsule that has the active ingredient Retinol which is applied to the entire face in a thin layer after washing the face. After 10–15 minutes, it has to be followed with a moisturizer. Nothing else should be used on the skin alongside retinol. Retinol is a retinoic acid derivative that sort of “remodels” the skin. It helps with acne and at the same time, it prevents wrinkles from forming in future.Vit C capsules by Dr Reddy (Revibra c-10). Ascorbic acid is a potent anti-oxidant that fights against free radical damage and also has a proven role in hyperpigmentation, especially sun induced skin pigmentation. This is also a skin irritant and I use it just once a week. My mother tolerates both retinol and vit C better, so she uses them on alternate nights. This has to be customised as per ones skin tolerability. This also helps to fade acne hyperpigmentation.The acne treatment drugs (topical) - Ive experimented with all the anti acne topical drugs and the two which seem to have the highest tolerability by my sensitive skin are :Adapalene (again a retinoic acid derivative). It has to be applied as a very thin single layer over the entire skin area and not dabbed as blebs on just the acne. Adapalene and retinol should NEVER be used concomitantly. Whenever there is active acne, Adapalene alone is sufficient. I use the deriva cms gel which is a combination of Adapalene with clindamycin (antibiotic).Nadifloxacin : For pustules, this works well. It is less irritating than clindamycin on my sensitive skin.When there is active acne, these drugs have to be given sufficient time to work. They do not work overnight. Benzoyl peroxide irritates my skin and Im not a fan of the drug. Salicylic acid and glycolic acid wipes available as Acnepads in India come in the form of pre-soaked skin pads. They can be used once a while to chemically exfoliate the skin. I do not use a face scrub for exfoliation. Another salicylic acid containing product is the innisfree bija mask that can be used once a week and left on for 15–20 minutes.The Body shop tea tree night mask contains tea tree and salicylic acid. It can be used weekly overnight (I use it on top of a moisturizer to prevent drying)All the products Ive mentioned are extremely mild and should ideally not cause any issues to sensitive skin but I still advise a face to face consultation with a doctor to avoid any unwanted effects. (The innisfree aloe gel is a mild soothing gel that can be used on face after sun exposure. It is not a mandatory component of acne care)Post acne skin care:- Acne erythema: I did not do anything specifically for erythema. Once the acne is more under control, the erythema fades over a period of few months,provided the skin is not tampered with. One new product that Ive recently incorporated in my skin care is the Avéne thermal spring water. My brother calls it tube-well water! But, there are a few articles I came across online that have spoken about the benefits of thermal spring water in management of skin inflammation. Im still in the experimental phase with this.Acne hyperpigmentation: Just like erythema, hyperpigmentation starts to fade when acne is in control. Additionally, sun protection and using something like Vit C or Kojic Acid on affected areas will help. This needs patience but it will eventually go away.Acne scars: This is the most difficult to treat. It needs in patient visits with a dermatologist. Topical therapy will not be 100% effective. Scars are dents on the skin surface left over by nodulo-cystic acne (most commonly) or if someone scratches / squeezes any other kind of acne. The golden saying: do not touch your face except during skin care!Lifestyle changes:It is not proven that oily food causes acne. However, Ive noticed that during periods of stress, when I crave junk, my skin tends to have mild breakouts. Avoiding refined sugar, high fat foods and processed food is beneficial for the overall health in the long term and I feel they do help in achieving clear skin.Changing pillow cover every alternate day because the face tends to touch the pillow at night.Using an anti-dandruff shampoo (active ingredients : Ketoconazole, salicylic acid, ciclopirox, ZPTO). Those with acne tend to have oily scalps too which is a perfect habitat for the lipophilic fungus Malassezia.A general healthy lifestyle (avoid smoking, drinking), stay active and happy. Ive noticed acne worsening and popping out of nowhere when Im unhappy and frustrated (before every exam!).I avoid milk and milk products (except Epigamia plain yogurt which is a fermented product). In a lot of people, milk is known to trigger breakouts.A lot of antioxidants in diet. I have a minimum of 2 fruits everyday and a whole lot of colourful vegetables. My diet is incomplete without fruits and vegetables, every single day.And finally, be gentle to and love your skin. Itll repay you back when youre older 😃. Good skin in 50s and beyond is definitely something to die for! (I look at it that way 🙄)￼Tips for choosing the correct skincare products:Look for products that are fragrance free and colour free. Colour, fragrance are unnecessary additives that have no role in skin care.There is a website called cosdna which gives a summary of different ingredients in a product and their purpose. I use it to identify potential comedogenic ingredients in products that I buy.Avoid highly foaming cleansers, they strip off all the oil from face and in turn, stimuli the sebaceous glands to become hyperactive.Scrubbing with a highly exfoliating scrub does not help. Id advise to avoid it.While choosing a moisturizer for face, look for good ingredients like these :Pic: Im not fond of putting solo pictures online but this just to show that acne is something a lot of us struggle with and a good lifestyle alongside good skincare will go a long way in keeping it under control. This was taken at the end of 3rd year, in natural light and no foundation / concealer on skin. Hope that helps! 🙂 |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Hey!

THERE IS NO QUICK FIX TO ACNE! There...band-aid ripped off! The path to clear skin is often one of trial and error; you might need to try several acne remedies before you find the right treatment for the types of acne affecting your skin. Before trying acne medication, you may prefer to give different natural acne treatment options a chance. While theres no research supporting the effective use of natural acne treatments, here are two popular options that you may want to try. 1. Coconut Oil Coconut oil is all the rage, with uses ranging from hair conditioning to cooking. But some swear by it as a natural acne treatment. To use coconut oil as an acne treatment, you can include it as part of a healthy diet. Or, you can apply a very small amount and rub directly onto your skin after cleansing for an extra hydrating boost. 2. Tea Tree Oil Some people swear by the disinfecting power of tea tree oil for acne treatment. It can be applied either full strength or slightly diluted with water directly onto pimples. Use a small amount on a clean cotton swab or cotton pad and dab on the affected areas immediately after cleansing. Because tea tree oil can be drying, you might choose to use both tea tree oil and coconut oil for acne as part of your clear skin regimen.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersIncorrect: Listening to loud music slowly gives me a headache.Correct: When I listen to loud music, I slowly develop a headache.A squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify. Misuse of lie/layIncorrect: He was laying on the couch.Correct: He was lying on the couch.If you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object. It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating. Comma splicesIncorrect: He was very hungry, he ate a whole pizza.Correct: He was very hungry. He ate a whole pizza.He was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza. To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice. The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others. Run-on sentencesIncorrect: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night however she prefers roses.Correct: Lila enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night; however, she prefers roses.Run-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence. To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences: Example: Lily enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her on prom night. Example: She prefers roses. Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses. Using “could of” instead of “could have”Incorrect: Sam could of received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.Correct: Sam could have received an A on his essay, but he made too many grammatical mistakes.“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.” TautologiesIncorrect: Jack made a water pail with his own hands for Jill.Correct: Jack made a water pail for Jill.Tautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!

It is a general term used to describe any software that is designed to perform an unauthorized or harmful action. Malware can be used to steal personal information, like credit card numbers, passwords, and bank account information. It can also be used to gain access to a computer system without the owners knowledge.

Because of these potential problems, there are two things you can do; 1) protect your computer against future malware infections and 2) manually remove malware from your computer. Here’s how you do it: 1. Protect your computer against future malware infections Installing a malware removal tool on your computer is one of the best ways to prevent future malware infections and remove existing ones. A malware removal tool is a program that is designed to scan a computer for malware and remove it. There are many malware removal extensions for Chrome but the one we recommend is Guardio. Full disclaimer, this is our Chrome extension. Guardio is an anti-malware program that removes existing malware from your computer and prevents new malware infections. It does this by blocking harmful sites, extensions, and push notification providers that try to insert malware on your computer. Our dashboard provides you insights on your past activity like how many harmful websites, information leaks, suspicious websites, search hijackers, and intrusive pop-ups it has blocked.After you install Guardio on Chrome, it will automatically scan your computer to look for unwanted popups, information leaks, harmful apps, and to check your overall system health. If it finds a problem, it will automatically remove the malware source. Then it will work in the background to keep you safe while you browse through the internet. 2. Manually remove malware from your computer. Chrome has a feature that allows you to scan your computer for malware and remove it. It’s great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections. To start scanning your computer, all you have to do is visit your Chrome settings and at the bottom of the page, under “Advanced” you’ll find a section called, “Reset and clean up”.Click “Clean up computer” and then “Find” to start scanning your computer. After it finishes removing the malware it finds, you’ll be asked to restart your computer. Do it and you’ll have completed the process. Again, this process is great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections so add an extra layer of security to stay safe while browsing the internet. Install a malware removal tool like Guardio and have peace of mind in knowing that it will actively work to protect you. We hope you found this information helpful and that you are able to fully remove malware from your computer.

WASH the rice, dammit. Some people soak it, swirl it and drain it till the water’s clear. I prefer using a very fine colander and running water through it until the rice feels a lot more coarse. I let the water drain out, and make sure it’s clear. (EDIT: forgot to add how much water I use → 1.5 cups of water to 1 cup of rice after washing) BOIL the water with some kind of fat (I prefer butter, but olive oil, coconut oil, ghee, and avocado oil have all worked fine). I use 1tbsp per cup, give or take (I don’t actually measure it). I also add a bit of salt, half a teaspoon of turmeric (if powdered; a little less if fresh and grated), cumin powder, coriander powder and a little bit of cinnamon. In that order. 1 tsp of each, except for the cinnamon…use less. Use this kind of pan:ADD the rice to the boiling water…let it boil violently for about 3 minutes. Do not stir. Let the water do the work. Add/adjust spices and oil if you really feel like you need to…but at this point you really don’t need to. LOWER the heat to a setting just above the minimum. Put in a tiny bit more oil/butter. (EDIT: I wrote this answer when I had a gas stove. Now that I have an electric, I just turn the burner off completely and leave the pan there…then go to the next step) COVER the pan. If you don’t have a lid, use another pan. If you don’t have another pan, sit on the damn thing. I honestly don’t know what you’d do without covering the pan…you will have failed at this point if you don’t have one. Not just at making rice, but at life itself. I’ll still give you a hug, though. LET the rice work its magic. Contemplate the journey of each grain. Realize that each grain knows what to do, and you don’t. You are stupider than a grain of rice…but then again, only when it comes to cooking yourself. Give yourself a high 5. Or, if you have a significant other, reach out and touch them. Be civil, though. CHECK the rice after about 12min. If you see what I call the “rice holes” (see picture), you’re doing great. Give it a light stir, cover again, and turn off the heat. Now would be a good time to go for a smoke if you smoke. If you don’t, then by no means should you start. You might want to use this time to wash any outstanding dishes, call your mom, or make sure your pets have been fed. However you choose to live your life is really up to you.ADD some fresh herbs to the top to make your fragrant rice even more fragrant and also very attractive.

However, the ratio may vary slightly depending on the type of rice and personal preference. Check the packaging or use the recommended ratio for the specific type of rice youre cooking. 3. Combine rice and water: In a saucepan, add the rinsed rice and the measured water. You can also add a pinch of salt for flavor if desired. 4. Bring to a boil: Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the rice and water to a boil. 5. Reduce heat and cover: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer. 6. Cook the rice: Allow the rice to cook undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Avoid lifting the lid during this time, as it can interfere with the cooking process. 7. Let it rest: Once the rice is cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This resting period allows the rice to steam and become fully tender. 8. Fluff the rice: After the resting period, use a fork or a rice paddle to gently fluff the rice, separating the grains. This helps prevent clumping and ensures a light, fluffy texture. Remember, cooking times may vary depending on the type and quality of rice, as well as your stoves heat settings. It may take a few attempts to find the perfect cooking time for your preferred rice variety.","ooking rice perfectly involves a few key steps to ensure that the rice comes out fluffy, separate, and not overly sticky.

A fruit fly infestation can quickly spiral out of control if steps aren’t taken at the first sign of a fruit fly problem. They’re small, numerous and peskier than most other insects as they swarm around produce feast on the sugars in rotting and fermenting fruit (check your garbage disposals regularly, y’all). They’re also so pesky, it’s no wonder everyone wants to know how to get rid of fruit flies. For such a short life cycle, adult flies wreak some serious havoc. With a 30-day lifespan and a staggering breeding rate – females can lay 400 eggs in a week’s time – adult fruit flies seem to come from nowhere and multiply right before your eyes. They’re attracted to damp areas with anything they can eat (rotten fruit in particular is their favorite food source), making them regular pests in compost piles, garbage cans, the kitchen sink, grocery stores, markets, and restaurants. These buggers are even a nuisance to wineries and breweries – the fly can find fermenting juice or wine from a half-mile away, and carry loads of bacteria that can ruin a glass – or whole cask – of wine or beer. Unforgivable. So how do you deal with them once you figure out the source of their breeding grounds? Don’t worry, here are five DIY ways and fruit fly traps to keep your home fruit fly-free without using hazardous or expensive chemicals. 1. Vinegar Trap The vinegar trap is a tried-and-true homemade fruit fly trap classic. Fruit flies are attracted to the scent of apple cider vinegar – earning them the common nickname ‘vinegar flies’ – and can’t resist flying into the jar. Once they’re in, they can’t get out. You’ll need a mason jar, 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, dish soap, a funnel, and optionally, a piece of overripe fruit. Basically, you’re creating the perfect circumstances to create a fruit fly breeding ground. Heat up the apple cider vinegar in a small saucepan to release the scent – fruit flies find it irresistible – and pour it into your container, adding a few drops of dish soap along with it to break surface tension and keep them from feasting and flying off. You can also add a piece of overripe fruit to make it more attractive to flies. Place a funnel in the top of the jar – a rolled-up piece of paper is fine – which allows flies in, but not out. You can also add a piece of fresh fruit to make it extra enticing. 2. Fruit trap Fruit flies are attracted to – you guessed it – fruit. Why not tempt them with their favorite? You’ll need a mason jar, overripe fruit, plastic wrap, and a toothpick. The fruit trap works on the same principle as the vinegar trap. Place a piece of overripe fruit in the bottom of your container. Next, securely cover the opening with a sheet of plastic wrap (or your paper funnel). With your toothpick, poke a few holes in the plastic. The flies will be able to get in – but they won’t make it back out. 3. Red wine trap Fruit flies like wine almost as much as you do. Why not use that to your advantage and keep them away from your wine for good? You’ll need a mostly empty wine (or beer) bottle. After you’ve enjoyed said bottle of wine, leave the last little bit in the bottle – I know, it’s not easy – and leave the cork out of the neck of the bottle. Place near the source of the flies and wait a few days. You can also transfer the wine to another container, and cover with punctured plastic wrap. They may have died, but at least they died drunk. Luckily for the beer-lovers among us, a leftover bottle of brew works as well. 4. Milk and sugar trap Claire Goodall over at Everyday Roots dug up an interesting fruit-fly remedy she found passed down in the Old Farmers Almanac from 1850s New England. You’ll need one pint of milk, 1/4 pound of raw sugar, and 2 oz. of ground black pepper. Combine milk, sugar and pepper in a sauce pan and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour this mixture into shallow bowls and place them in problem areas around the house 5. Keeping them gone Don’t forget, these traps may take care of the adult population, but there still may be larvae lurking. To keep them from coming back, make sure your kitchen and home is free of standing water, mop buckets, leaking pipes, etc. If a stinky sink seems to be the source, dilute a capful of bleach with 12 oz. hot water and pour it in the drain. Given their love for rotting food, make sure trash cans are closed and trash bags are tied up tight. Fruit flies also love dirty dishes, so now’s the time to tackle that pile in the sink. If you have houseplants, poor-quality soil could also be a problem. Many cheap potting soils contain fungi and decaying organic matter that attract fruit flies. Switch to better soil, and top your potting mix with a layer of aquarium gravel or course sand to keep hatched larvae from crawling out.","ruit flies can be the bane of every homeowner’s existence, no matter what time of year it is.

Given their love for rotting food, make sure trash cans are closed and trash bags are tied up tight. Fruit flies also love dirty dishes, so now’s the time to tackle that pile in the sink. If you have houseplants, poor-quality soil could also be a problem. Many cheap potting soils contain fungi and decaying organic matter that attract fruit flies. Switch to better soil, and top your potting mix with a layer of aquarium gravel or course sand to keep hatched larvae from crawling out. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

A fruit fly infestation can quickly spiral out of control if steps aren’t taken at the first sign of a fruit fly problem. They’re small, numerous and peskier than most other insects as they swarm around produce feast on the sugars in rotting and fermenting fruit (check your garbage disposals regularly, y’all). They’re also so pesky, it’s no wonder everyone wants to know how to get rid of fruit flies. For such a short life cycle, adult flies wreak some serious havoc. With a 30-day lifespan and a staggering breeding rate – females can lay 400 eggs in a week’s time – adult fruit flies seem to come from nowhere and multiply right before your eyes. They’re attracted to damp areas with anything they can eat (rotten fruit in particular is their favorite food source), making them regular pests in compost piles, garbage cans, the kitchen sink, grocery stores, markets, and restaurants. These buggers are even a nuisance to wineries and breweries – the fly can find fermenting juice or wine from a half-mile away, and carry loads of bacteria that can ruin a glass – or whole cask – of wine or beer. Unforgivable. So how do you deal with them once you figure out the source of their breeding grounds? Don’t worry, here are five DIY ways and fruit fly traps to keep your home fruit fly-free without using hazardous or expensive chemicals. 1. Vinegar Trap The vinegar trap is a tried-and-true homemade fruit fly trap classic. Fruit flies are attracted to the scent of apple cider vinegar – earning them the common nickname ‘vinegar flies’ – and can’t resist flying into the jar. Once they’re in, they can’t get out. You’ll need a mason jar, 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, dish soap, a funnel, and optionally, a piece of overripe fruit. Basically, you’re creating the perfect circumstances to create a fruit fly breeding ground. Heat up the apple cider vinegar in a small saucepan to release the scent – fruit flies find it irresistible – and pour it into your container, adding a few drops of dish soap along with it to break surface tension and keep them from feasting and flying off. You can also add a piece of overripe fruit to make it more attractive to flies. Place a funnel in the top of the jar – a rolled-up piece of paper is fine – which allows flies in, but not out. You can also add a piece of fresh fruit to make it extra enticing. 2. Fruit trap Fruit flies are attracted to – you guessed it – fruit. Why not tempt them with their favorite? You’ll need a mason jar, overripe fruit, plastic wrap, and a toothpick. The fruit trap works on the same principle as the vinegar trap. Place a piece of overripe fruit in the bottom of your container. Next, securely cover the opening with a sheet of plastic wrap (or your paper funnel). With your toothpick, poke a few holes in the plastic. The flies will be able to get in – but they won’t make it back out. 3. Red wine trap Fruit flies like wine almost as much as you do. Why not use that to your advantage and keep them away from your wine for good? You’ll need a mostly empty wine (or beer) bottle. After you’ve enjoyed said bottle of wine, leave the last little bit in the bottle – I know, it’s not easy – and leave the cork out of the neck of the bottle. Place near the source of the flies and wait a few days. You can also transfer the wine to another container, and cover with punctured plastic wrap. They may have died, but at least they died drunk. Luckily for the beer-lovers among us, a leftover bottle of brew works as well. 4. Milk and sugar trap Claire Goodall over at Everyday Roots dug up an interesting fruit-fly remedy she found passed down in the Old Farmers Almanac from 1850s New England. You’ll need one pint of milk, 1/4 pound of raw sugar, and 2 oz. of ground black pepper. Combine milk, sugar and pepper in a sauce pan and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour this mixture into shallow bowls and place them in problem areas around the house 5. Keeping them gone Don’t forget, these traps may take care of the adult population, but there still may be larvae lurking.

Cooked Caesar Salad Dressing Makes about 1/2 cup Not quite up for using the raw egg yolks called for in classic Caesar dressing? Not a problem: Swap them out for a whole hard-boiled egg instead. With the help of some lemon juice, Dijon mustard, anchovies (which are optional, but highly recommended) and olive oil, it blends into a smooth and creamy salad dressing. In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine 1 peeled hard-boiled egg, about 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 3 anchovy fillets (optional), 1 peeled clove of garlic, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of salt, and fresh-ground black pepper and process until smooth. While still running, slowly drizzle in 1/3 cup of olive oil, processing just until emulsified.2. Brûléed Hard-Boiled Eggs Adventurous eaters, this one’s for you! I first saw this amazing idea on Bon Apétit, and just had to give it my own little riff with hard-boiled eggs and turbinado sugar. This sweet and salty snack is one for the books. Cut a peeled hard-boiled egg in half lengthwise, sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt (like Maldon) and turbinado sugar. Then use a kitchen torch or broiler to melt the sugar.3. Avocado Egg Salad Forget eggs on top of your avocado toast — it’s time to add the avocado to your eggs. Skip the mayo and use mashed avocado with a super-creamy texture and a lighter flavor. Serve it between bread, or on top of Wasa crackers or greens. In a medium bowl, stir together 2 peeled and chopped hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 mashed avocado, 1 teaspoon ground mustard, 1 diced celery stick, salt, and fresh-ground black pepper.4. Mediterranean Tostada This Mediterranean take on a tostada is your answer to just about any meal or snack of the day. It doesn’t get more versatile than this. Lightly brush a corn tortilla with olive oil, then heat on the stovetop until crisp. Top with a layer of mashed roasted red peppers (homemade or store-bought), 1 peeled and sliced hard-boiled egg, and chopped fresh parsley.","ard-boiled eggs will always be perfectly delicious cracked, peeled, lightly sprinkled with salt, and eaten just the way they are, but there are some quick and easy ways to make even the simplest preparation better.

I have written the answer with my whole heart. I practically test everything I have stated here. Be ready to read this answer until the end for more valuable insights that will help your blogging journey. I hope this answer will help you to grow more with my insights. How to start a BLOG? Right? This question comes into thousands of peoples minds. They made tons of searches on Google and ended up with the frustration of visiting from one site to another. And, the same question came to my mind as well, and I also did the same. Now, you are in the right place with a helpful answer. So, How did I Start my Own Blog? The answer is straightforward because I was interested in Smartphones. Ans, I wanted to utilize that effectively, so I chose Blogging. What is Blogging? (As a Beginner) Blogging is writing about what you like. In other words, writing about what you know and providing valuable information to people searching for it. Let’s understand it more deeply. For instance, you know how to use professional cameras. Now, you can create a blog and share your knowledge about DSLRs. Now, think of a person who is searching for How to set up XYZ Camera manually? So, if you know about it, you can write an informative blog on it, and Google can show the same who are searching for it. You can also earn from a blog in several ways, such as Adsense, Sponsors, Affiliates, and more.What are the Reasons Behind Starting a Blog? There could be several reasons behind starting your own blog. Everyone has a different thinking perspective. Here’s what I commonly find.If you are interested in something, do utilize it, whether making YouTube videos or starting your own blog.A blog gives you an Online Identity.It can give you more fame. But that could be only possible after putting in dedication and hard work.A Blog can be a LIVE ATM Machine for you. But never start your own blog for the sake of earning money from the very next day. It will take time. And, do not be hopeless after hearing this painful line.Now, here I have written a practical Step-By-Step Guide on How to Start a Successful Blog? Read it below. How to Start A Successful Blog? — Step-By-Step Guide STEP 1. Choose a Niche (topic/interest) Hey, what do you mean by a niche? Can you please elaborate on it? I am new to this game. Do not worry; I will elaborate on everything in detail for you. In short words, a niche can also be known as a topic. And, you can understand the topic as an interest. For instance, I was interested in Technology. So, I started my blog on Smartphones Technology. STEP 2. Start Looking at other Websites in your Niche What do I mean by Start Looking on to other websites in your niche? Start visiting the website which comes under your place. Take inspiration for their content, such as How they write. Are they using Hard words? I would say start judging the other websites which come under your niche. After evaluating most of the sites, make your own structure and road map of your site. Take other websites mistakes as your advantage Step. 3. Take a Pen and Notebook or Use Online Notetaking Resources Now, start writing content ideas on that note. If you really wanted to be successful in blogging. I would say research about your interest or niche for almost 7 days. Your next step should be finding Content Ideas, i.e., on which you will write, e.g., If I am starting a Travel Website. So, I would write topics such as Best 5 Places to visit in Delhi With Friends or Best 5 Temples to Visit in Delhi. Remember you will need to do something which has not been done by anyone yet. Now, after doing the above steps. It is time to implement them. A Domain and Best Hosting for your Website You might not understand these terms because you are new to them. Let me make a small glossary to understand better. What is a Domain? A domain is the unique name of your website. For Eg. Google. Com. Are you still confused? Let me make it more straightforward for you. For instance, Shambhu takes an interest in body building. Now, he wants to start his own blog because he is passionate about it. Now, Shambhu can choose a domain name called Shambhubodybuilding.[com]. Is it clear to you?What is Hosting?Hosting means a Virtual Space to store data on your website. Still vague? Lets take an example. Have you heard about Google Drive? If yes, then you must also have aware of how it stores you Videos, Documents, Picture at single place. Thats what Hosting does. Now, the Domain and Hosting both terms seem technical, but they are not much.Is Domain Name and Hosting Costs for Free?I know you are curious to know about it. The answer is No. But wait, the price of every domain varies from store to store. On average, a domain costs Rs. 800. And a hosting cost of at least Rs. 199/month. I am not going to talk about how to set up a blog. Because it is effortless to do it, and everyone can do it by watching a few YouTube tutorials. Thank you for understanding. What are the Other Requirements? You will need a Domain and Hosting to start a blog. Yes, I have already mentioned these things above as well. So, why am I repeating it? Because I need your attention. The two most important things are remaining. Have you noticed above, I had written How to Start a Successful Blog instead of Start a Blog? The word Successful matters the most. If you want to start a successful blog. You have to keep in mind that you need to work harder and be more dedicated to your BLOG. Keep in mind, without Passion, Hard Work, and Dedication, you would not achieve your goals. Remember the phrase: You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. What are the Mistakes I Have Made in My Blogging Journey? I had made countless blunders with the first blog. Still, I am happy because I have learnt something new with every mistake, and now, I can share them with you. I have listed my blunders below. 1. Choose a Profitable Niche: What do I mean by a Profitable Niche? The more profitable niche you choose, the more you will earn. There are several ways to make from a blog—for instance, Google Adsense, Sponsors, Affiliate Marketing, Sponsor Articles, Brand Collaboration, etc. But not every niche can earn from the methods mentioned above. For Eg, a movie downloading website can not earn from Google Adsense.2. Do not Copy Content from Other Websites: This is the huge blunder I made when I was new in this industry. And, I do not want you to make the same mistake. Do not ever copy content from your competitors site. Moreover, Google will not rank your website. As a result, you will not be able to earn. 3. Do not Apply Everything Simultaneously: It could be possible that you have planned different strategies for your blog. But in a rush, you apply every approach without even waiting for the results. Apply techniques to your site by giving them time to show results and analyze them properly. 4. Give Time to Your Learning As we all know, learning takes time. Do not try to learn everything on the same day. Your knowledge would not be helpful unless you implement it on your blog or whatever you are doing. You will not learn everything quickly; it will take time to understand the whole process. Be patient. 5. Do Not Quit, If You Are Not Getting Results. Yes, it had happened to me as well. But due to dedication and passion, I was able to keep myself in the game. I was also not getting traffic at the starting of 4–5 months. But still, I was writing because I knew one day I would beat my competitors as well. You will not believe I had ranked my article on Googles first page under 5 minutes the span after publishing. 6. You Should Not Compare Your Blog with Someones Else Blog I said, do not compare your one-month-old blog with a one-year-old blog. You will not grow your blog if you give attention to someone elses blog just because he is getting traffic and youre not. Focus on your blog and take the necessary actions to grow it. Implement hard. 7. Do Not Spam Sometimes, to bring more traffic to the blog, we usually spam the blog URL on several social media platforms. And, as a result, we get a disheartening ban from social media. In my case, I was spamming my blog URL in a Facebook group, and unfortunately, Facebook banned my domain from their platform. So, the next time, I was not able to get traffic from Facebook anymore. 8. Be Consistent! Take a paper and write Be Consistent several times. Trust me! If you follow this quote. Your blog is going to be super successful. Consistency is the key to success. According to me, a newbie blogger should write at least 100 blogs for continuous 100 days. Remember the point when I said, write all the topics in one place, and find all the topics in your niche in advance. Mark my words, you will not face any content shortage issue. 9. Optimum Utilization of Resources Make profiles on the name of your blog and optimize it accordingly. Promote it like a brand; tell it to your friends, family, colleagues. Utilize all the resources present on the internet, whether it is social media, forums, and more. You will be able to make it successful. 10. Learning is the Most Important Thing I am thankful that I have not stopped learning in the early stages of blogging. But still, I am sharing it because few people just start their blog and do not discover other tactics and strategies to grow their blog. Remember one thing, growth is essential. If you are not learning, you are learning. Learn something new every day. 12. Implement Properly As I said above, learning is essential. The next important step which comes after learning is implementing what you have learned. If you are only busy learning and not implementing it. Then, buddy, that knowledge is just a theory for you unless you practically try it. No, the mistakes are countless. But these were the same mistakes I wanted to highlight. Do not be afraid of making mistakes. Advice For New Bloggers 1. Quality and Quantity Content Both Matter. It does not matter that every long article will rank on Google. Articles with more information and lesser words also rank much faster and higher. Do you remember that 5 minutes example? Yes, I had also implemented the same strategy with that article, and it ranked in the first position under 5 minutes. That was incredible. 2. Write Articles/Blogs on Problem Solving Queries Most of the newbie articles always target a broader audience. Newbie bloggers should write articles on specific search queries. Let me explain more about this. For instance, a person is searching on Google, How to Install Google Camera on XYZ Smartphone? And, Google is actually looking for someone who has written a whole article on this specific query with valuable information. No more storytelling and all, only clear target answers. If Google thinks you are the one, it will definitely rank you. Now, you can rank faster by writing articles on specific search queries. 3. Find Loopholes in Your Competitors Article and Take Advantage Of It When you will start finding loopholes or mistakes in your competitors articles. On that day, you will start getting higher rankings if you implement it harder. Take your competitors mistakes to your advantage. 4. Keep an Eye on Your Website Speed Website speed is one of the significant factors behind rankings. If your website speed is slower than ever, Google will not rank you by any chance. Because if users face problems with your site speed. As a result, Google will not rank you. So, keep checking your website rate once a week. Try to use 7–8 essential plugins maximum. Moreover, use a lightweight theme such as Generate Press. 5. Keep Making Backlinks Backlinks are essential for ranking but not more than the quality of your content. Try to make profile backlinks. Profile Backlinks are easy to make, but they may consume your time. Still, I hope you can invest your time in better rankings. 7. Consistency is the Key I am focusing on consistency because it is essential for better rankings. The best way to let Google know about your website presence is consistency. In the starting days, you will see your Google position is changing every day, also known as Google Dancing. It is familiar with new sites. 8. Write Content in Easy and Readable Language Every new blogger should write the content in an easy to read language. It is not necessary to show off your strength in English by writing hard to read articles. Write content that can be read by a ten year old child and 20 year old person as well. 9. Build Presence on Social Media Platforms Social Media is the best way to bring traffic to a new website. I am repeating, use social as much as you can to build your brand. But do not break their guidelines, or they will ban you. Here, I am sharing a picture of one of my favorite social media profiles called Pinterest. Pinterest had brought me 500+ visitors per month. Still, I do not believe it. Have a look.Want to Know More About How to Start A Blog From Scratch? You can read this step-by-step guide on How to Start A Blog From Scratch In 2022.

If you are not learning, you are learning. Learn something new every day. 12. Implement Properly As I said above, learning is essential. The next important step which comes after learning is implementing what you have learned. If you are only busy learning and not implementing it. Then, buddy, that knowledge is just a theory for you unless you practically try it. No, the mistakes are countless. But these were the same mistakes I wanted to highlight. Do not be afraid of making mistakes. Advice For New Bloggers 1. Quality and Quantity Content Both Matter. It does not matter that every long article will rank on Google. Articles with more information and lesser words also rank much faster and higher. Do you remember that 5 minutes example? Yes, I had also implemented the same strategy with that article, and it ranked in the first position under 5 minutes. That was incredible. 2. Write Articles/Blogs on Problem Solving Queries Most of the newbie articles always target a broader audience. Newbie bloggers should write articles on specific search queries. Let me explain more about this. For instance, a person is searching on Google, How to Install Google Camera on XYZ Smartphone? And, Google is actually looking for someone who has written a whole article on this specific query with valuable information. No more storytelling and all, only clear target answers. If Google thinks you are the one, it will definitely rank you. Now, you can rank faster by writing articles on specific search queries. 3. Find Loopholes in Your Competitors Article and Take Advantage Of It When you will start finding loopholes or mistakes in your competitors articles. On that day, you will start getting higher rankings if you implement it harder. Take your competitors mistakes to your advantage. 4. Keep an Eye on Your Website Speed Website speed is one of the significant factors behind rankings. If your website speed is slower than ever, Google will not rank you by any chance. Because if users face problems with your site speed. As a result, Google will not rank you. So, keep checking your website rate once a week. Try to use 7–8 essential plugins maximum. Moreover, use a lightweight theme such as Generate Press. 5. Keep Making Backlinks Backlinks are essential for ranking but not more than the quality of your content. Try to make profile backlinks. Profile Backlinks are easy to make, but they may consume your time. Still, I hope you can invest your time in better rankings. 7. Consistency is the Key I am focusing on consistency because it is essential for better rankings. The best way to let Google know about your website presence is consistency. In the starting days, you will see your Google position is changing every day, also known as Google Dancing. It is familiar with new sites. 8. Write Content in Easy and Readable Language Every new blogger should write the content in an easy to read language. It is not necessary to show off your strength in English by writing hard to read articles. Write content that can be read by a ten year old child and 20 year old person as well. 9. Build Presence on Social Media Platforms Social Media is the best way to bring traffic to a new website. I am repeating, use social as much as you can to build your brand. But do not break their guidelines, or they will ban you. Here, I am sharing a picture of one of my favorite social media profiles called Pinterest. Pinterest had brought me 500+ visitors per month. Still, I do not believe it. Have a look.Want to Know More About How to Start A Blog From Scratch? You can read this step-by-step guide on How to Start A Blog From Scratch In 2022.

You can host websites from your own computer, but then you would need to always leave your computer on (and most likely, your upload speeds arent fast enough for web hosting).

You will need: A web host: A web host is essentially a computer in some data center that is connected to really fast internet.  It stores the files for your website and delivers them to anyone that tries to view your website.  You can host websites from your own computer, but then you would need to always leave your computer on (and most likely, your upload speeds arent fast enough for web hosting).  Web hosts come in a variety of flavors.  You can find a free web host, which will give you limited control, space, and functionality.  Or you can pay a small monthly or yearly fee for a shared web host.  A shared web host has multiple customers served from the same machine.  You get a little more control, but not total control.  Finally, you can pay a larger monthly or yearly fee for a dedicated or VPN server.  A dedicated server is a computer in a data center that you pretty much have to yourself.  You can pay for an unmanaged server (you have to manage it yourself, keeping it secure, installing what you need, etc), or you can pay to have a hosting company manage it for you.  A beginner is probably best suited for a cheap shared host.  Some decent shared hosts include: http://e-rice.net, http://nearlyfreespeech.net, http://dreamhost.com, http://hostgator.com, http://westnic.net.A domain: A top-level domain is yourname.com.  If you use a free web host, they might provide you with a URL like freehost.com/users/~example/ that you can use.  Any serious web work will probably require that you buy a top-level domain, however.  You shouldnt pay more than $10 for a domain name.  A good domain registrar is http://namecheap.com.  Once you have registered a domain, you need to set its nameservers to the nameservers of your web host.  Your web host should tell you what these are.  After that, it will take up to 72 hours before you can view your website from your domain (this is due to DNS propagation).A website: A website is a collection of HTML pages and related files (stylesheets, images, videos, flash files, fonts, configuration files, etc).  The first thing you want to do is learn HTML.  There are a lot of tutorials for HTML, and I recommend that you find a tutorial for HTML 5.  HTML lets you control what content goes inside of a website.  It lets you control its structure.  You write HTML in a text editor and save it as filename.html.  You can link HTML files to each other with hyperlinks to create a full-fledged website.  You can embed images and videos into websites with HTML as well.  Once you learn HTML, youre going to want to learn CSS.  CSS lets you style your HTML so that it looks nice and lines up the way you want it to.  You can make brilliant websites with HTML and CSS alone.  However, as you learn more, you will want to learn a server-side programming language like PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET, or JSP.  These programming languages will allow you to create dynamic pages that allow users to create, edit, and delete data.  They allow you to do extra processing.  They let you create things like hit counters, guestbooks, forums, user account systems, commenting systems, etc.  Any data that changes is probably best dealt with by using a server-side language.  At about the same time you learn server-side programming, you should also probably learn client-side JavaScript programming.  JavaScript lets you add additional functionality that happens when a user interacts with HTML elements on a page.  It can load content dynamically, change styles dynamically, and respond to user input.  It runs in real-time when the user is on the page (as opposed to server-side code, which runs before the HTML content is delivered to your browser).  Once you pick up all these languages and technologies, you will be able to create a bunch of different files and folders that make up a website.  However, in order to make your website usable, you will need to put these files on your web server.  Some good beginner tutorials can be found at http://htmldog.com.FTP/SFTP: Once your website is ready to go live, you need to put it on your web server so that other people can access it.  Typically, beginners will learn to use an FTP client, which is a program you can install that lets you connect to your web server and upload the files of your website.  A good FTP client is Filezilla.  You can download the desktop client from http://filezilla.com.  Once you have paid for shared or dedicated web hosting, you will most likely be given the login credentials for FTP.  Then you login with your FTP client, drag the files to your server, and youre all set.  You should be able to access your website from the domain you bought!  SFTP is a more secure protocol that allows you to do the same things FTP does.  If you web host supports it, get an SFTP client like WinSCP and upload your website using it instead.  A lot of this is really complex.  Once you have the big picture, you can start asking more specific questions to help you along the way.  Good luck!

Whether I was in the car, having a meal with my family, on vacation - it really didn’t matter. I said I was “bored.” I remember so vividly this seemingly insignificant, but life-changing moment I was in the car with my parents and brothers when I repeated my favorite repetitive sentence when my dad stopped the car and turned to me and said, “Boredom is a state of mind, not a fact.

When you’re bored, you ARE boredom. There’s no such thing as a situation being boring. Saying you’re bored is a sentence about your being, not the situation.” I was 13 at the time. The wisdom hit me like a ton of bricks; for the first time I thought - “what the hell does it even mean to BE bored?” Like anything else in life, an adjective we use to describe a situation usually has NOTHING to do with the situation itself, but how we’re relating to it. Saying “this is boring” or I’m bored” simply means that we’ve decided to relate to a circumstance as boring. It means that we haven’t been able to find a relationship to this circumstance as interesting, fun, or enjoyable. This is going to seem a little harsh, but I don’t intend it as an insult in any way. Sometimes we need a little bit of reality to change the way we’re thinking about something. So - to answer your question of what you should do when you’re bored - realize that boredom is a state of mind, and find a way to relate differently to your circumstance.

There are a number of truly groundbreaking books out there that provide a solid foundation of poker theory that will serve you well no matter how your personal playing style evolves.  Some books I would HIGHLY recommend: The entire Harrington on Hold Em series - Dan Harrington has been credited amongst the poker community with completely changing the landscape of the game.  His books were revolutionary in that they exposed some very high level secrets of the game that up to that point were only really known by elite professionals.  His books more than any other leveled the playing field between amateur and professional and hugely contributed to the meteoric rise of many of the best young players on the circuit today.  Although, the original series was geared towards Hold Em tournament play, he has subsequently published a couple books aimed at the cash game player as well that are equally as profound.Doyle Brunsons Super System was also ground breaking at the time of its publication and many players credit that book with their growth as poker players.  Doyle takes a more ecumenical approach and includes basics for a number of different poker variations, not just Hold Em.Any books published by Two Plus Two publishing by the likes of David Sklansky, Tom McEvoy, Howard Lederer, etc. are all sure to be high quality reads - look for some introductory books published by them to get you started and then gradually work your way through to more advanced material as you feel ready to.Winning Poker Tournaments One Hand at a Time, by Jon PearlJammer Turner, Eric Rizen Lynch, Jon Apestyles Van Fleet - these guys are some of the most prolific and highly regarded tournament players that all got their start playing in and winning some of the most prestigious online poker tournaments.  Now they are all highly successful winners in the live poker arena as well.  If you have a desire to learn about Tournament Poker, they are truly some of the best teachers you could ever hope for and the style of this book is great because it draws from real life hands that each player has played and they go through their thought process for each hand in great detail.  This book is very rich with content and I would really only recommend it once youve read a couple more introductory books and got a little playing under your belt. ONLINE POKER TUTORIAL WEBSITES:Another way of learning about the game would be to join one of the online poker tutorial sites, which all have varying levels of monthly or yearly dues involved.  These sites use videos with either live recordings of online games in progress or custom graphical replays of games played narrated by some of the top online players in the game as they talk about their reasoning for playing hands the way they do.  This type of learning, though not for everyone, will create some of the most rapid growth in you as a player because you get an inside view of some of the best players in the game and what goes through their minds as they play.  Two of the most highly regarded tutorial sites are PokerXFactor.com &amp; Cardrunners.com.  You cant go wrong with either of them, although Cardrunners is more geared toward cash game play and PokerXFactor is geared more towards tourney play.  They can seem pricey at first, but believe me when I tell you, if you are serious about the game, the money invested will be paid back in huge dividends from your winnings after just a few months or even weeks learning diligently from these sites. ONLINE POKER FORUMS:Yet another way to learn is to join a reputable poker forum site like PocketFives.com or TwoPlusTwo.com.  They are both FREE and there is always plenty of lively poker strategy discussion and high quality articles to read as well as podcasts, etc. PLAY, PLAY, AND PLAY SOME MORE:Lastly, the best way to learn is by getting out there and playing.  You have to put in many hours of play to get good.  Although there are plenty of online poker sites that have play money tables, it is hard to learn much from playing on these due to the highly erratic nature of play money playing styles.  The best thing to do is to either get a home game going with some friends and play for really low stakes or to join an online poker site and deposit the minimum they allow and play the lowest real money stakes they allow.  You will very likely lose your initial deposit, so be sure it is not an amount that will affect you financially. A Word of Caution: One last piece of advice, which is a strong word of caution - do NOT attempt to learn about the game from watching it on TV.  Although I love watching the World Poker Tour and World Series of Poker on TV and find them highly entertaining and at times even insightful, they are not a good learning tool because the number of hands you actually see are drastically reduced from the number of hands actually played.  This is because so many hands would be boring to watch as most players fold their hand or there is little to no action.  So they creatively edit those shows to only highlight the most interesting hands.  Yes, because the editing and commentators are so good at what they do, there will be times when you may doubt that there have been hands edited out, but trust me - they do.  And in those nose-bleed level buy-in tournaments there is also an incredible amount of VERY high level thinking and people reading skills that these pros are engaging in, that attempting to evaluate their play at face value can be very dangerous.  They have all often played with each other multiple times and have done their homework on each other, so there is a whole meta-game taking place beneath the surface that is highly psychological that the average viewer would never be privy to. I know this was a long answer, but I hope those serious about the game have the patience to read it in its entirety, as first and foremost patience is one of the key virtues of a great poker player!  Good luck...hope to see you at the tables!","There are quite a few options available to the modern player to learn how to play poker, all at varying levels of financial commitment.

His books more than any other leveled the playing field between amateur and professional and hugely contributed to the meteoric rise of many of the best young players on the circuit today.  Although, the original series was geared towards Hold Em tournament play, he has subsequently published a couple books aimed at the cash game player as well that are equally as profound.Doyle Brunsons Super System was also ground breaking at the time of its publication and many players credit that book with their growth as poker players.  Doyle takes a more ecumenical approach and includes basics for a number of different poker variations, not just Hold Em.Any books published by Two Plus Two publishing by the likes of David Sklansky, Tom McEvoy, Howard Lederer, etc. are all sure to be high quality reads - look for some introductory books published by them to get you started and then gradually work your way through to more advanced material as you feel ready to.Winning Poker Tournaments One Hand at a Time, by Jon PearlJammer Turner, Eric Rizen Lynch, Jon Apestyles Van Fleet - these guys are some of the most prolific and highly regarded tournament players that all got their start playing in and winning some of the most prestigious online poker tournaments.  Now they are all highly successful winners in the live poker arena as well.  If you have a desire to learn about Tournament Poker, they are truly some of the best teachers you could ever hope for and the style of this book is great because it draws from real life hands that each player has played and they go through their thought process for each hand in great detail.  This book is very rich with content and I would really only recommend it once youve read a couple more introductory books and got a little playing under your belt. ONLINE POKER TUTORIAL WEBSITES:Another way of learning about the game would be to join one of the online poker tutorial sites, which all have varying levels of monthly or yearly dues involved.  These sites use videos with either live recordings of online games in progress or custom graphical replays of games played narrated by some of the top online players in the game as they talk about their reasoning for playing hands the way they do.  This type of learning, though not for everyone, will create some of the most rapid growth in you as a player because you get an inside view of some of the best players in the game and what goes through their minds as they play.  Two of the most highly regarded tutorial sites are PokerXFactor.com &amp; Cardrunners.com.  You cant go wrong with either of them, although Cardrunners is more geared toward cash game play and PokerXFactor is geared more towards tourney play.  They can seem pricey at first, but believe me when I tell you, if you are serious about the game, the money invested will be paid back in huge dividends from your winnings after just a few months or even weeks learning diligently from these sites. ONLINE POKER FORUMS:Yet another way to learn is to join a reputable poker forum site like PocketFives.com or TwoPlusTwo.com.  They are both FREE and there is always plenty of lively poker strategy discussion and high quality articles to read as well as podcasts, etc. PLAY, PLAY, AND PLAY SOME MORE:Lastly, the best way to learn is by getting out there and playing.  You have to put in many hours of play to get good.  Although there are plenty of online poker sites that have play money tables, it is hard to learn much from playing on these due to the highly erratic nature of play money playing styles.  The best thing to do is to either get a home game going with some friends and play for really low stakes or to join an online poker site and deposit the minimum they allow and play the lowest real money stakes they allow.  You will very likely lose your initial deposit, so be sure it is not an amount that will affect you financially. A Word of Caution: One last piece of advice, which is a strong word of caution - do NOT attempt to learn about the game from watching it on TV.  Although I love watching the World Poker Tour and World Series of Poker on TV and find them highly entertaining and at times even insightful, they are not a good learning tool because the number of hands you actually see are drastically reduced from the number of hands actually played.  This is because so many hands would be boring to watch as most players fold their hand or there is little to no action.  So they creatively edit those shows to only highlight the most interesting hands.  Yes, because the editing and commentators are so good at what they do, there will be times when you may doubt that there have been hands edited out, but trust me - they do.  And in those nose-bleed level buy-in tournaments there is also an incredible amount of VERY high level thinking and people reading skills that these pros are engaging in, that attempting to evaluate their play at face value can be very dangerous.  They have all often played with each other multiple times and have done their homework on each other, so there is a whole meta-game taking place beneath the surface that is highly psychological that the average viewer would never be privy to. I know this was a long answer, but I hope those serious about the game have the patience to read it in its entirety, as first and foremost patience is one of the key virtues of a great poker player!  Good luck...hope to see you at the tables! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","There are two parts of poker you need to understand: The making and ranking of poker hands.The betting and gambling part (including folding and bluffing).The first is the easiest, the second by far the more important. Standard poker hands are 5 cards that form ranked hands (mostly from most rare, to most common).  A higher rank hand beats a lower rank hand if both make it to the phase of being compared for rank.

Standard poker hands are 5 cards that form ranked hands (mostly from most rare, to most common).  A higher rank hand beats a lower rank hand if both make it to the phase of being compared for rank.  Hands of the same rank are compared by the highest card used as part of the rank (As are generally high, except if they are used in an A-2-3-4-5 straight in which case the 5 is the high card, otherwise it is standard order for cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10/T, J, Q, K, A is the order from low to high) then by left over cards if still tied.  And then if still tied it can be a split pot where both players tie. From high to low these hands are:Straight flush.  All 5 cards the same suit and all 5 cards in a row.  The highest possible straight flush is AKQJT of the same suit and is called a Royal Flush and is the highest standard poker hand.4 of a kind.  4 of your 5 cards are of the same rank. When QQQQ2 is compared to JJJJK the QQQQ2 is higher because it is 4-queens which beats 4-jacks with the extra card no mattering.  If the 4 of a kind were the same (possible in games where you can share cards with opponents or where wild cards are possible) then the extra card matters.Full House.  Your 5 cards come in just 2 ranks with 3 of one rank and 2 of the other.  When you rank full houses you do so by the 3-card rank.  So QQQ22 is better than JJJKK.  If full houses are of the same 3-card then the rank of the pair matters.  So JJJKK beats JJJTT.Flush.  All 5 of your cards are of the same suit.  When comparing 2 different flushes, which suit they are doesnt matter, but the rank of the cards does matter.  So AT643 of diamonds beats KQJT8 of spades (because the A beats the K) while AK543 of spades beats AK542 of diamonds (because the A and A are tied, the K and K are tied, the 5 and 5 are tied, the 4 and 4 are tied, but the 3 and 2 are different).Straight.  All 5 of your cards are in a row, but they arent all the same suit.  So 6d 7h 8c 9h Td is a ten-high straight.  3-of-a-Kind.  You have 3 copies of one rank, and your other two cards are other ranks (not the same).  So QQQJ4 might be 3-queens.  As with other ranks the 3-of-a-kind are intraranked by the rank of the 3 so TTT32 is higher than 999AK.  If the 3-of-a-kind are the same then you use the other cards so TTTKQ is lower than TTTA2 because the T is tied and the A beats the K.2-pair.  You have 2 different pairs of ranks with a 5th card of a different rank.  So KKTT2 is two-pairs Kings and Tens.  You rank these cards first by the bigger pair, then by the smaller pair, then by the extra card.1-pair.  You have 1 pair of a rank and 3 different cards of all different ranks.  So AA852.  You compare these 1-pair hands by the pair rank first, then the extra cards.Nothing.  You have 5 different ranks, they arent all the same suit, and they arent all sequential.  So AQJ62 of not all the same suit.  You compare these hands by what there highest card is, moving to next highest rank when tied.  So KQ432 is higher than KJT98 because the Ks tie but the Q beat the J.Depending on the form of poker you make your hands in different ways.  You could do it by everyone just getting 5 cards and that is it.  But that is rare.  More commonly youll either have a draw element (you get 5 cards but you get the chance to discard some of your cards and get new ones) or an element where youll get more than 5 cards (often 7 cards) and be able to make the best poker hand from any 5 of those 7.  In westerns the game is usually 5-card draw.  In TV poker today and many casinos the game is texas holdem (where you end up with 7 cards, some of them shared with everyone, and want to make the best 5 card hand). A lot of poker games are played with partial information.  Which means you know something about the other players hands.  In Texas holdem this is done by:Everyone gets 2 cards that only they can see.  There is a round of betting.3 cards are dealt face up on the table that will be shared by everyones hand.  There is a round of betting.1 more card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is another round of betting.1 final card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is a final round of betting.If you survive to the end and a showdown against other players then youll compare your best 5 card poker hand mixing the 2 private cards you had at the start and the 5 shared public cards.  You can use any mix of 2 private, 3 shared or 1 private, 4 shared, or 0 private, 5 shared to make your hand (but if you use 0 private, 5 shared you will be at best a tie with the other players still in). In contrast, a typical game of 7-card-stud is played where there are no shared cards, but some of the cards are private, and some of the cards are face up and known to anyone (but only used by one player).  The steps here are: Everyone gets 2 cards facedown and 1 card faceup in front of them.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup (but it is just their card).  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 final card facedown.  There is a round of betting.In the end if multiple players are left for the showdown each player will make their own best 5 card hand from amongst their own personal 7 cards.  Because you can see 4 of their 7 cards face up you know that hand needs to use at least 2 of the faceup cards, so you have some hint about what their hand can be.  Further, you can know which cards cant be in their hand by eliminating the cards that other players had face up as well as the cards that you yourself have faceup as well as facedown. In all of these games you make inferences from the size and strength of the opponents betting actions (raising, calling, checking, etc.) as well as the inferences you can make about how strong their hands can be given what you know about which cards they have to be using and also physical demeanor of the opponent (tells).  In general, the strength of your hand then is less about where it is in the ranking of hands in an absolute sense but where it is likely to fall relative to your opponents on this particular hands (there are some hands where 3-of-a-kind is nearly certain or certain to be the winning hands, there are others where a flush might be quite likely to be a losing hand). Your goal is to win the hands where there is lots of money in the pot, and avoid putting much money into the pots you dont win/that you lose.  The easiest way to do this is to fold your bad hands and also your ok and even good hands if someone else is betting a lot showing a great hand.  Folding means that at some point in the hand when someone makes a bet you decide not to match that bet and give up on the hand.  You now cant win the hand at all, but you dont need to put any more money in the pot.  If you look at all of those betting rounds in texas holdem and 7-card-stud folding early is both your most common move and, arguably, your most important skill and move.  For this reason a lot of games have some sort of blind or ante structure where some players need to put money into the pot early on no matter their hands or even if they have a bad partial hand showing. But you can also sometimes win by pretending to have a great hand and convincing everyone else to give up (and your opponent might be doing that to you).  There can also be situations where players tend not to fold much at all, but also tend not to raise much at all.  You can also be a winning player in some similar situations by just betting aggressively or a lot on your good and great hands, and having your opponents call you action (match your bet).  Now the pots when you have great hands might be $10 and the pots where you had less good hands and werent betting might be only $5.  If you win your equal percent of pots, but 80% of your wins are the $10 pots, youll win more money than you lose. So in general when someone bets money it could be:They have a better hand than you and want you to put more money in the pot so theyll win a bigger pot.They have a better hand than you right now, but they dont want you to keep playing in case you catch up, and they want you to surrender the pot right now.They have a worse hand than you and they want to trick you into folding.  This is known as bluffing.They have a worse hand than you right now, but they have some chances to have a better one if the right things happen, and they want to have you off balance or unsuspecting of it if they do get that better hand (something like 4 cards to a flush).Sometimes it is a combination of some of the above (especially 3 and 4 as a semi-bluff).  And sometimes the player is wrong about the ranking of the hands (I.e., they might think they are bluffing with a worse hand, but actually have a better hand.  Or they might think it is case 1 and they are building a big pot for their better hand, but only their hand is worse than yours and they are actually building your big pot for you). Poker is a very easy game to learn.  But can take more of an effort to get good at.  To be a professional poker player or a very good poker player there can also be a lot of skills to develop and master outside the direct poker game itself including emotional control (tilt control) for how well you deal with being unlucky or even lucky as well as critical skills like table/opponent selection (it is better to be the one-hundred-thousandth best poker player in the world playing against opponents who arent in the top million than to be the 50th best poker player in the world playing against just the top 10 best poker players) and also the importance of bankroll management. There can be also be many other variants of poker either with wild cards, or involving passing cards amongst opponents, or making low hands instead of high hands, or what not (some of these still quite serious poker variants, some more silly dealers choice home game only variants).  But in general it is always a combination of using betting with a ranking of the hands.","here are two parts of poker you need to understand: The making and ranking of poker hands.The betting and gambling part (including folding and bluffing).The first is the easiest, the second by far the more important.

Live poker is interesting, but with 6 hands an hour you will not really get the experience as quicky as the typical grinder who plays 40k+ hands a month. Here comes the caution: You are playing a highly addictive game, and you are playing it a lot. The emotional rollercoaster you will go trough as a serious poker player is something you cant prepare for (in the sence that you would never expected it to be like that). The high and lows can be insane. It can be depressing, you will pull out your hair and you will be in lots of pain during downswings. Downswings can really take a big toll on your mental and psychical health. People literally went crazy because of poker and its damned hard to have a balanced life. Almost every grinder I know stayed up extremely late to play at the best time possible. Almost every grinder I know neglected something (being it family, career) at some point because of poker.This game has the power to suck you up and pull you into a rabit hole only the strongest will survive. You will either end up quiting, end up playing once in a while or playing as a complete low-life because you focussed to much attention to poker while you should have been working on other stuff.Some people become professionals. I have been one, and I know a lot of people that where pro. You can make a decent earning if you hit midstakes. But, are you really going to do this for the rest of your life ? Probably not. But you still need to put in most of your time to stay on top of your game to be able to continue to play mid stakes, or aiming to get to higher stakes. This will suck you up. High stakes is like the NFL, only talent and a very sick work ethic will get you there.  2. Learn about the mental game of pokerI think people focus to much on strategy while the mental game of poker is one of the hardest aspects of the game. To stay tilt-free, that means not getting upset when you get a bad beat (which happens a lot, especially when you are good at it. The better you get, the more people will make mistakes versus you. That means, in a downswing, hardcore pain if you are not tilt-free), being able to grind for hours and hours a day, letting the game go when you are done, ... One of the best books on the market for this are:Amazon.com: The Mental Game of Poker: Proven Strategies for Improving Tilt Control, Confidence, Motivation, Coping with Variance, and More. (9780615436135): Jared Tendler, Barry Carter: BooksandElements of Poker: Tommy Angelo: 9781419680892: Amazon.com: Books These books are must reads for any aspiring poker player. 3. Learn the strategy of the gameObviously, strategy is super important. Why you should not limp pre flop, when to 3-bet and why, why you probably should cold call pre flop way less often than you think, why being the pre flop raiser is important, the importance of position... The more you learn, the more you will realise you dont know anything at all.This mean, besides all those hours you play the game, you also need to learn the game. This means doing hand reviews (analyzing the session you have played), talking strategy with people, reading books, watching poker videos. If you really love it, you will probably spend most of your time playing and thinking about poker. You can go to a training site to learn the game:Free Poker Videos : Poker Coaching : Win at PokerDeuces cracked has a very good poker forum, which is free and full of helpful people. LeggoPoker - Win All The Money Phil Galfond, one of the best poker players in the world, opened a new poker training site which sounds very, very promising:Run it Once If you want to learn live, most training sites also have some live poker in its arsenal. Plus, being good on-line, you will destroy live poker.  Besides that, you can always read some books, like:Easy Game: Making Sense of No Limit HoldEm 3rd Edition: Adaptations: Andrew Seidman: 9781466411975: Amazon.com: Books Small Stakes No-Limit Holdem: Ed Miller, Matt Flynn, Sunny Mehta: 9780984143498: Amazon.com: Books Those two are really good, be careful with picking just any book.

This includes Harrington, Sklansky, Phil Gordon and all those guys you always see on TV There are many things to be learned. Just be aware of the downsides of poker. Its an awesome game. But it also destroys lifes. Dont let that discourage you, I think poker learns you a lot, about life, about yourself, about people, about logic.

Live poker is interesting, but with 6 hands an hour you will not really get the experience as quicky as the typical grinder who plays 40k+ hands a month. Here comes the caution: You are playing a highly addictive game, and you are playing it a lot. The emotional rollercoaster you will go trough as a serious poker player is something you cant prepare for (in the sence that you would never expected it to be like that). The high and lows can be insane. It can be depressing, you will pull out your hair and you will be in lots of pain during downswings. Downswings can really take a big toll on your mental and psychical health. People literally went crazy because of poker and its damned hard to have a balanced life. Almost every grinder I know stayed up extremely late to play at the best time possible. Almost every grinder I know neglected something (being it family, career) at some point because of poker.This game has the power to suck you up and pull you into a rabit hole only the strongest will survive. You will either end up quiting, end up playing once in a while or playing as a complete low-life because you focussed to much attention to poker while you should have been working on other stuff.Some people become professionals. I have been one, and I know a lot of people that where pro. You can make a decent earning if you hit midstakes. But, are you really going to do this for the rest of your life ? Probably not. But you still need to put in most of your time to stay on top of your game to be able to continue to play mid stakes, or aiming to get to higher stakes. This will suck you up. High stakes is like the NFL, only talent and a very sick work ethic will get you there.  2. Learn about the mental game of pokerI think people focus to much on strategy while the mental game of poker is one of the hardest aspects of the game. To stay tilt-free, that means not getting upset when you get a bad beat (which happens a lot, especially when you are good at it. The better you get, the more people will make mistakes versus you. That means, in a downswing, hardcore pain if you are not tilt-free), being able to grind for hours and hours a day, letting the game go when you are done, ... One of the best books on the market for this are:Amazon.com: The Mental Game of Poker: Proven Strategies for Improving Tilt Control, Confidence, Motivation, Coping with Variance, and More. (9780615436135): Jared Tendler, Barry Carter: BooksandElements of Poker: Tommy Angelo: 9781419680892: Amazon.com: Books These books are must reads for any aspiring poker player. 3. Learn the strategy of the gameObviously, strategy is super important. Why you should not limp pre flop, when to 3-bet and why, why you probably should cold call pre flop way less often than you think, why being the pre flop raiser is important, the importance of position... The more you learn, the more you will realise you dont know anything at all.This mean, besides all those hours you play the game, you also need to learn the game. This means doing hand reviews (analyzing the session you have played), talking strategy with people, reading books, watching poker videos. If you really love it, you will probably spend most of your time playing and thinking about poker. You can go to a training site to learn the game:Free Poker Videos : Poker Coaching : Win at PokerDeuces cracked has a very good poker forum, which is free and full of helpful people. LeggoPoker - Win All The Money Phil Galfond, one of the best poker players in the world, opened a new poker training site which sounds very, very promising:Run it Once If you want to learn live, most training sites also have some live poker in its arsenal. Plus, being good on-line, you will destroy live poker.  Besides that, you can always read some books, like:Easy Game: Making Sense of No Limit HoldEm 3rd Edition: Adaptations: Andrew Seidman: 9781466411975: Amazon.com: Books Small Stakes No-Limit Holdem: Ed Miller, Matt Flynn, Sunny Mehta: 9780984143498: Amazon.com: Books Those two are really good, be careful with picking just any book. Poker books are even worse than diet books. Lots of garbage will be said. Avoid Phill Hellmuth as the plague.

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for you) I have experience in fleas and keeping them away. For indoor cats (or cats that go both indoor and outdoor) 1.) Isolate your cat in a room or area that does not have any cushion, carpet, fluff, anything nice and soft. (You can bring a small cat bed if you want, but you’ll have to wash it later.) Fleas lay eggs in such things. I usually bring my cat into a bathroom and remove the rugs. This way your flees cannot have more demonic offspring. 2) Has your cat laid, walked, stretched, or been near any cushion, carpet, or fluff? If so, proceed by vacuuming the heck out every area that cat has been near or that has had access to. I would suggest applying this before you vacuum, just for extra measures:Just sprinkle some carpet powder down on areas needing to be vacuumed. Remember that fleas can jump far. If fleas were the size of humans they could jump the length of a football field. After vacuuming, make sure to thoroughly empty out the vacuum bag. Fleas can even populate inside the vacuum bag. After, I suggest you use a flea warding or flea killing spray that’s for carpets and furniture. •If it’s only in a specific room, you can use a flea fogger. This is a spray that is activated for a few hours, trapping all of the little demon suckers and suffocating them in flea poison. You nor your cat will be able to access this room while the fogger is in act, however. •If you want to get lazy (not recommended because you may not get all of the fleas dead and gone) then use some carpet spray. I use this:You spray it and it kills. Amazing! •If you want to be extra precise and make sure you got the buggers out, do all of the above. For any blankets, rugs, cat beds, etc. wash in the washing machine! 3) Now that the (arguably) worst part is over, we can now treat your cat. If you do not have any money to spend towards helping humankind eliminate fleas from this earth, then I would suggest you bathe your cat. Good luck. •First, in a bathtub, large sink or large tub, run some warm water. Not scalding hot, not freezing cold. I wouldn’t say lukewarm because that’s still a little cold. Put a dry hand in the water and test it. Does it burn at all? If it does it’s too hot for your feline. •Fill this warm water up like a bathtub. You want it to be able to soak up to your cat’s neck. Before placing your cat in the water, prepare a few things. You will need a large towel to dry the bitter cold water off of your cat. A handtowel is nice for you, because you will also be splashing around. Some cat treats, to comfort your cat and let your feline know that there was purpose behind your wet torture. A small brush. By this I mean like a toothbrush or something of the sorts. This will come in handy later. Are you in a room where you can shut the door? If your cat is squeemish in water, he/she will try to run. Expect it. Expect your cat to panic and cry when you try to bathe him/her. He/she will try to jump out of the bathtub/sink/tub as that is natural cat behavior. Don’t let this persuade you into not bathing your kitty. Those devilish fleas will hurt that cat way more than a bath ever will. •Put soap into the bath water and stir it, so that the soap will be mixed all throughout the water. You want a good bit of soap in the water. For soap, I highly recommend just simple Dawn dish detergent. It kills fleas almost on contact, and is completely safe for your soft, cat’s fur. If you are not comfortable with Dawn, then there are some specific flea soaps you can get for your cat. But these will be more costly, and I can almost assure you they will not be as effective as Dawn is. •Finally! Secure your cat in your hands and place him in the water! Don’t do this so slowly that only a part of him is submerged in the water for more than a second. You want to submerge your cat in the water as fast as you can. Fleas are devilishly intelligent, and hate water. When they realize you are attempting to baptize them in water, they will jump to the safe spot-which is your cat’s head. More specifically, the inside of your cat’s ears. •After submerging your cat, quickly take the tiny brush (the toothbrush,) dip it in the soapy water, and brush along the entrance to your cat’s ears. If there are any fleas on his/her head, they will try to escape to their ears. Blocking off their ears with a witchcraft forcefield trail of Dawn soap will keep the fleas out. You may have to redip the toothbrush to get enough soap around his/her ears. Make sure you are not putting any water in your cats ears. Water in cat’s ears can cause an ear infection! •Then, using the toothbrush, brush along the cat’s face. Use the soap to delicately brush along the nose, around the eyes, and around the mouth. Be careful not to get any soap in your cat’s eyes, mouth, or nose! •If you see any fleas by this step, redip the toothbrush in the soap water and drown that flea to death. •Gather more (Dawn) soap in your hands and lather through your cat’s fur. Lather a small amount at the back of your cat’s head and neck. Rinse carefully. Look over your cat. Almost certainly, any body part or area that is submerged is clean of fleas. Do you see any flees hiding under his chin? Are there any flees at his neck? Are there any that have escaped behind the soap forcefield and into his/her ears? Use the brush, and apply the soap water (unless its in the ears.) •You’re done with the bath! Towel dry your cat and give him some treats so he/she won’t completely hate you. 4) To prevent fleas from coming back, I suggest getting him/her a flea collar or something like Advantix. Flea collar: A flea collar is basically just a collar for your cat, but keeps away fleas. Older flea collars are less effective, as they only prevent fleas that are near the neck. Newer flea collars use the cat’s natural fur oils to dispearse its heavenly flea poison. These typically last for 6–8months. Advantix and products of the sort: These work well too. It’s a liquid that you apply at the base of the cat’s neck. I’m actually not sure how this works too well, I just can approve that is does indeed work. My only suggestion is that you get this product from Advantix or another popular brand. Otherwise, the product won’t work very well or can even cause health issues to your cat. The popular brands last for a month, and come in packs for you to have a 4–8 month supply. The advantage to these versus flea collars is that they have always seemed to work better for me. Wearing a flea collar, also keeps your cat from wearing his/her actual collar, as it usually prevents the flea collar from working properly. Because of this, your cat won’t have an ID, and if anything occurred someone may not be able to contact you. This isn’t an issue if you don’t have an ID nametag on your cat or maybe not even a collar. The disadvantage is that they are much more costly, ranging at about $30–60 on Amazon. You also need to reapply it more frequently. If you do not use either, you’ll probably have to keep bathing your cat and washing your carpets for a good while until the fleas are all eliminated and the source of the fleas is taken care of. Flea eggs do not hatch for 2 weeks, so you’ll have to stay ontop of it! Good luck! For outdoor cats For outdoor cats, there isn’t a whole lot you can do.Have a bug exterminator come and spray for fleas. This will kill and keep fleas at bay, if he does a good job.Use one of the products I mentioned in step 4.Bathe your cat often, otherwise.If fleas are left to their own, it can cause diseases and poor torture to your precious feline. Don’t let them do this! I hope you manage your fleas and help humankind with elimination of fleas. Best of luck!","I hate fleas.

Before placing your cat in the water, prepare a few things. You will need a large towel to dry the bitter cold water off of your cat. A handtowel is nice for you, because you will also be splashing around. Some cat treats, to comfort your cat and let your feline know that there was purpose behind your wet torture. A small brush. By this I mean like a toothbrush or something of the sorts. This will come in handy later. Are you in a room where you can shut the door? If your cat is squeemish in water, he/she will try to run. Expect it. Expect your cat to panic and cry when you try to bathe him/her. He/she will try to jump out of the bathtub/sink/tub as that is natural cat behavior. Don’t let this persuade you into not bathing your kitty. Those devilish fleas will hurt that cat way more than a bath ever will. •Put soap into the bath water and stir it, so that the soap will be mixed all throughout the water. You want a good bit of soap in the water. For soap, I highly recommend just simple Dawn dish detergent. It kills fleas almost on contact, and is completely safe for your soft, cat’s fur. If you are not comfortable with Dawn, then there are some specific flea soaps you can get for your cat. But these will be more costly, and I can almost assure you they will not be as effective as Dawn is. •Finally! Secure your cat in your hands and place him in the water! Don’t do this so slowly that only a part of him is submerged in the water for more than a second. You want to submerge your cat in the water as fast as you can. Fleas are devilishly intelligent, and hate water. When they realize you are attempting to baptize them in water, they will jump to the safe spot-which is your cat’s head. More specifically, the inside of your cat’s ears. •After submerging your cat, quickly take the tiny brush (the toothbrush,) dip it in the soapy water, and brush along the entrance to your cat’s ears. If there are any fleas on his/her head, they will try to escape to their ears. Blocking off their ears with a witchcraft forcefield trail of Dawn soap will keep the fleas out. You may have to redip the toothbrush to get enough soap around his/her ears. Make sure you are not putting any water in your cats ears. Water in cat’s ears can cause an ear infection! •Then, using the toothbrush, brush along the cat’s face. Use the soap to delicately brush along the nose, around the eyes, and around the mouth. Be careful not to get any soap in your cat’s eyes, mouth, or nose! •If you see any fleas by this step, redip the toothbrush in the soap water and drown that flea to death. •Gather more (Dawn) soap in your hands and lather through your cat’s fur. Lather a small amount at the back of your cat’s head and neck. Rinse carefully. Look over your cat. Almost certainly, any body part or area that is submerged is clean of fleas. Do you see any flees hiding under his chin? Are there any flees at his neck? Are there any that have escaped behind the soap forcefield and into his/her ears? Use the brush, and apply the soap water (unless its in the ears.) •You’re done with the bath! Towel dry your cat and give him some treats so he/she won’t completely hate you. 4) To prevent fleas from coming back, I suggest getting him/her a flea collar or something like Advantix. Flea collar: A flea collar is basically just a collar for your cat, but keeps away fleas. Older flea collars are less effective, as they only prevent fleas that are near the neck. Newer flea collars use the cat’s natural fur oils to dispearse its heavenly flea poison. These typically last for 6–8months. Advantix and products of the sort: These work well too. It’s a liquid that you apply at the base of the cat’s neck. I’m actually not sure how this works too well, I just can approve that is does indeed work. My only suggestion is that you get this product from Advantix or another popular brand. Otherwise, the product won’t work very well or can even cause health issues to your cat. The popular brands last for a month, and come in packs for you to have a 4–8 month supply. The advantage to these versus flea collars is that they have always seemed to work better for me. Wearing a flea collar, also keeps your cat from wearing his/her actual collar, as it usually prevents the flea collar from working properly. Because of this, your cat won’t have an ID, and if anything occurred someone may not be able to contact you. This isn’t an issue if you don’t have an ID nametag on your cat or maybe not even a collar. The disadvantage is that they are much more costly, ranging at about $30–60 on Amazon. You also need to reapply it more frequently. If you do not use either, you’ll probably have to keep bathing your cat and washing your carpets for a good while until the fleas are all eliminated and the source of the fleas is taken care of. Flea eggs do not hatch for 2 weeks, so you’ll have to stay ontop of it! Good luck! For outdoor cats For outdoor cats, there isn’t a whole lot you can do.Have a bug exterminator come and spray for fleas. This will kill and keep fleas at bay, if he does a good job.Use one of the products I mentioned in step 4.Bathe your cat often, otherwise.If fleas are left to their own, it can cause diseases and poor torture to your precious feline. Don’t let them do this! I hope you manage your fleas and help humankind with elimination of fleas. Best of luck! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","I’ve had pets (dogs &amp; cats) for 66 of my 67 years.

This treatment will usually last up to 5 YEARS without re-treatment. The mechanism is simple. A flea must leave the host in order to complete the reproductive cycle. They hop into the carpet, down to the knap. There, they get coated with the boric acid and being tidy creatures, remove it from their body. The acid dessicates the insect and they die. If they live long enough to lay eggs, the boric acid will wipe out the hatchlings, too. Please note this treatment has no effect on humans. I raised to children who spent lots of time playing on the carpet. I’m a lover of being barefoot. Of course, the animals spend a lot of time laying on the treating areas. None have ever had any adverse effects. Finally, this treatment works on not only fleas, but spiders, ants, roaches, silverfish and many other insect pests.","’ve had pets (dogs &amp; cats) for 66 of my 67 years.

It was in the 170s, which didnt sound very high to me back then. Id already had a feeling, even in kindergarten, that I was pretty smart, and destined for greater things. That said, I was certainly not a mathematical prodigy, not bothering with algebra until I was 12. I just really enjoyed drawing, writing, and reading, although I found that I skimmed through passages more often than not. I enjoyed reading dictionaries and encyclopedia.

It was in the 170s, which didnt sound very high to me back then. Id already had a feeling, even in kindergarten, that I was pretty smart, and destined for greater things. That said, I was certainly not a mathematical prodigy, not bothering with algebra until I was 12. I just really enjoyed drawing, writing, and reading, although I found that I skimmed through passages more often than not. I enjoyed reading dictionaries and encyclopedia. When I was 8, I took part in a national exam to identify gifted children and place them in a separate education program. I remember finding the tests ridiculously easy, although some of my friends in the program said theyd only managed to solve a quarter of the problems and still got in. So Ive always been among the smartest of my peers, even when I was mixing with the elite. Yet somehow that never translated to academic excellence. It might have had something to do with the workings of my brain, because I was a very left-brained child, with autistic tendencies almost. Or it could just be how everything seemed so obvious and straightforward to me. Math was fine, but I would have trouble with anything requiring written answers, such as science. I could never understand what teachers meant when they asked me to elaborate my answers. I did below average among students in the program, but still good enough to continue in the program and enter the best school in the country. My academic performance was very discouraging to me. I felt like an idiot compared to everyone else in class. I stopped trying. I spent all my time playing computer games, not even doing any casual reading. I wonder how much my mental development stagnated in those days. Even so, I would show flashes of brilliance, answering questions in class that no one else had any idea about. I aced German tests without even studying. And I always had the sharpest wit around. By the time I went to uni I realised that intelligence alone wasnt enough for success and happiness in life. I worked on my social skills, making more friends of varying levels of intelligence. I started to gain an appreciation of other things in life, such as aesthetics and the humanities. Although I went to a pretty good university, I never met anyone of comparable intellectual ability in 4 years. (One thing I could always do was figure out how intelligent a person was just from talking to them, because I could discern the thought processes behind what they said or did.) Maybe I should have gone to Harvard instead. Then again, most geniuses would have skipped grades and hence be much before their prime while in uni.  During my undergraduate years, I was skipping most classes but still doing well. I spent the time on autodidacticism instead. My interests proliferated throughout this time. I taught myself Japanese. I became a foodie. I dabbled in fashion. I explored architecture and interior design. I wrote short stories and composed songs. Whatever I did, I found that I could bring my intelligence to bear and understand it on a deeper level. I started to see the links between all things, and that which makes us human. An amalgam of practical and academic interest saw me go from neuroscience and psychology into philosophy, which used to make me fall asleep in high school but now keeps me up at night. After years of denial, I have finally returned to my true calling. I get into a state of flow just reading and thinking about things. This must be what Aristotle meant when he said the highest purpose of Man was thought. I am making up for lost time now. I spend hours a day reading. I have come to terms with my intellectual passion, and at my age (24) its no longer something nerdy or geeky to hide, although you do want to describe it in a way that makes you sound like just another human being with his particular passion. Now I am doubly afflicted, being both more intelligent and more knowlegeable than everyone else I know or am likely to meet. Yet my continuous efforts at learning and contemplating have revealed to me, every few months, what a fool I was a few months ago, and how I will laugh at myself in a few months time. I realise that the most important thing about living as an intelligent person is to be meta-intelligent, i.e. to be intelligent about how you apply your intelligence. Intelligence is a gift, although of course I would say that, wouldnt I. It can also be a curse, if it leads you to wander in the labyrinths of thought, never finding a way out like Newton or Einstein did. But mostly it is a tool, and it is not the right tool for every job. There are times when it is smarter not to think through a problem, where heuristics will satisfice, where neuroplasticity or conditioning provides a better response, where tradition contains hidden wisdom. Use your intelligence to diagnose the things you need to change or learn, and do it. Control the urge to show off, and be truly humble (as C.S. Lewis said, humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less). There are many more realms in this world than the intellectual, and others may know much more about these than you. Try to see things in the way that others do, and speak to them in ways they can appreciate. Nonetheless, I still yearn for intellectual companionship, both for emotional reasons and for the purpose of synergy, because you can spot the flaws in each others thought, and also come up with things that neither could have thought of alone. And at this stage in life the right ideas can really bring you places. So for those of you who have come to treat your intelligence as just another part of your life, something inessential and to be suppressed when inconvenient, I urge you to reconsider, and to discover the joy that a life of intellectual pursuit holds."," was hyperactive as a kid, which was what prompted the IQ testing.

However, it was high enough to experience some things that I think come with higher IQs. Here they are, good and bad.1. Easy to pick any new concept SUPER fast. Was always bored at school. I could easily get any complex concepts just by picking up sentences and keywords from textbooks and would always get high grades with little to no effort. Helped me a lot in corporate life: new software, new process, new department, new challenge - all of those were easy.2. Short attention span. Once I cracked the concept - I loose any interest in it which made it close to impossible for me to focus on the issue any longer. This would lead to silly errors at school too. E.g. I would at times get an average grade on the toughest Algebra test just because of stupid spelling errors (misspelling b vs. d or vice versa). Or may be this is some other issue unrelated to IQ? 3. Loneliness and exclusion from social life at younger age (pretty much all self-inflicted). I guess it also depends on who surrounds you. As for me, I could not understand the interests of my peers and they did not understand mine. I tried to hang out with them and do what they did, but it was foreign to me and I did not enjoy it. Hence, my best past-time was reading books. Lots of them. Now my wife and kids are all I need from the social life perspective. 4. Self analysis and analysis of EVERYTHING whats going on around me. Every aspect of my behavior, emotions, responses to certain triggers are broken into pieces and analyzed by my brain almost constantly, even when I am actually experiencing that event. For example, while talking with somebody my brain runs a parallel process that goes something like this: Why did I just say this? Do I really think I can convince this person? Whats the origin of my desire to prove her/him wrong? and it leads to a conclusion that when I was 6 my grandpa told me so and so, and it had such and such impact on me and the key components of what I was told at 6 are present in this conversation, and so on. And while this is happening, I am still present in the conversation and the two processes seem to run completely independently from each other.5. Unable to stop thinking. This is super exhausting. Especially when I am tired, my brain takes off on its own and I think of 1000 different thoughts a minute (just my guess - I never counted). They change each other at great speed and surprisingly I have enough time to go into greatest details in each one of them. For example, my brain writes a short poem, thinks about a complex mechanism, solves a mathematical problem - and everything is very clear, crisp and if I write it down - it makes perfect sense in the morning. I dont control this process and I dont know how to stop it or channel where it would be more useful.6. Bad memory (absent-mindedness). I dont know if this may be a contradiction to a high IQ. But I am only interested in concepts and those I never forget. But small details, settings - they never exist for me. I am very absent-minded about some day-to-day things. I never remember where I put household things for example, and when I find certain things in certain places - I have no memory of how they got there. This is the worst for me. Again, I dont know if this is related to  IQ or if this is due to some medical condition I am not aware of.7. Harder to communicate. At work, when asked to work on a problem I solve it in my head conceptually and explain that to co-workers. They dont get it and this annoys hell out of me. If I am forced to write step-by-step instructions - I usually feel like quitting. I actually did quit at some point and run my 2nd business now. The best solution came when I had my first child: if I talk to a client as if s/he were a kid - that usually works perfectly!8. Get irritated and impatient when somebody takes time to explain the simplest concept to me! Sometimes I find myself finishing the sentences for people, interrupting, or asking to make the point and move on. I know its bad but this is a intellectual torture for me.9. Find logical disconnects in what I am being told. When I would ask to clarify those, people usually dont understand what I mean. When I (shortsightedly) used to explain what I meant I would end up in a worse situation, whether people got it or still could not get it. Now I rarely ask people to reconcile the points they make.8. Cant pass on any intellectual challenge. If I am told something is unsolvable or impossible to do - I cant take it out of my mind until its solved. I learned the most from this. On a smaller level I even avoid Sudokus or anything that could occupy my mind needlessly.9. I dont watch TV. At all. I use other sources if I need information and there is nothing else I could use a TV for.10. I used to get into a lot of trouble by talking about what I consider to be true vs. what was the commonly accepted and politically correct version of the truth. Surprisingly, I knew that I would get in trouble and I would still do it as a rebellion against the society and people who would accept any garbage at face value, just because its easier, more convenient, accepted by most... or broadcast on national TV channel. I recently discovered Paul Grahams post on what not to say - I enjoyed it a lot. My intellect brings me a set of pros and cons and I cant say if this is a blessing or a curse. For one, I dont know an alternative. This is something that I have without any effort so its just a part of who I am.","ine wasnt that high - 156.

This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop.

Professional Summary Write a 4 to 6 line summary that describes your best professional accomplishments and capabilities. This is usually the first section to catch an employer’s eye, and must answer the question, “What do you bring to the table?” In your summary, use language from the job description to show how you can answer the employer’s needs and demands. REMEMBER : The employer is not at all interested about your CAREER OBJECTIVE. Instead, they need to know how your years of experience will help achieve their organizational goals. Skills Your skills section should be a list of 6 to 8 of your most relevant capabilities. Read the complete job description to see what the company needs, and match your most relevant skills to the description. Include a variety of “hard skills” (the technical qualifications you have for a job) and “soft skills” (your interpersonal talents, such as customer support). These are vital to highlight how your skills match the employer’s needs. Work Experience This section is particularly important and it focuses on showing off your work history. It should always include your job title, name of the organization, and your employment tenure dates for each job with your most recent job mentioned first. Under each entry, describe your responsibilities and achievements. Use industry-specific metrics, numbers, such as percentages or sales revenue to add tangible and measurable proof to your claims. Education Section. Your education section usually carries less significance than your skills and work history sections, although it can play an important role. In writing this section, list your most advanced degree first and mention other qualifications such as certificates in order. Top 10 Resume Facts You Need to Know . Recruiters spend an average of only about 6 to 8 seconds on each resume before deciding whether to invite a candidate for an interview. . The first 10-15 words of your resume are the most important; that’s how many words the average person can read in those 6 to 8 seconds. . The top one-third of your resume often determines whether a hiring manager chooses to keep reading or not. . Your professional / career summary is the section of your resume a recruiter is most likely to read. . Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for specific terms and key words. ATS search terms are mostly correlated to job descriptions. . Changing the wording of a keyword from the job description even slightly, for example, from “project management” to “project manager” could cause the ATS to eliminate you as it is a very sensitive system. . Many ATS cannot recognize abbreviations as common as “CIMA” “CPA” or “ACCA”. It is crucial that a job seeker needs to highlight any abbreviation in order to avoid any sort of elimination from the ATS. . Unusual fonts, spacing, and images can also throw off an ATS system and reject your application. . Typos can easily sabotage your resume. Recent studies from various employers showed that of the most common mistakes applicants make on their resumes, 48 percent are related to misspellings. Make sure you perform a final resume check before submitting. Conclusion Your resume is your passport to land a job in a new organization. The type of template you choose as you decide how to write a resume can help or hurt your chances of getting the job you want. Consider the expectations of your field, as well as your experience level. As you write your resume, working with a chronological format with standard headings and font choices will reassure employers with more formal corporate cultures that you are serious, well qualified, and ready to contribute. It will also clearly showcase your career trajectory at a glance.","esumes can be divided into five major sections.

They are literally an internal scar your body builds to protect your body from being torn open. Your body is an amazing machine. When machines are used, they begin to show wear and tear. It just is what it is. They sell all manner of creams and potions to get rid of them, but it is more about the massaging them than what you put on them, that makes the color fade. Do not fall for the hype. Baby oil is great for massage, and costs very little. Massage brings circulation to the area and helps heal, so the color fades faster. Excercise also helps with the fading, but either way it will take time. Did you know that there are people on Earth like me, who have much less ability for their skin to stretch and when girls like me begin to mature and their bodies begin to change shape, they develops huge wide stretch marks over the hips, over the buttocks, and especially around each breast? For about three years my breast skin was mostly purple. Count your blessings. When I had my first child, I weighed 140 lbs at 5’9” on the day she was born, and she weighed 8 lbs. I have one stretch mark right down the middle of my tummy that was over an inch wide! Just for the record I do want you to know stretch marks are ignored by all but the most ignorant of humans.

Common types include diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and others. The specific medication and dosage will depend on your individual circumstances. 2. Dietary changes: Adopting a healthy eating plan can have a significant impact on blood pressure. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is often recommended, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Reducing sodium (salt) intake is also crucial, as excessive sodium consumption can contribute to high blood pressure. 3. Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight or working towards weight loss if overweight can help lower blood pressure. Losing even a small amount of weight can have a positive impact. 4. Regular exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, along with strength training exercises twice a week. 5. Limit alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure. Its generally recommended to limit alcohol consumption to moderate levels, which means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. 6. Quit smoking: Smoking raises blood pressure and damages blood vessels. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your overall health, including blood pressure control. 7. Stress management: Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as practising relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, yoga), engaging in hobbies, or seeking support from friends and family, can be beneficial. 8. Limit caffeine intake: While the effects of caffeine on blood pressure can vary among individuals, it may be helpful to limit caffeine intake if youre sensitive to its effects. Monitor your blood pressure after consuming caffeinated beverages to see if there is an impact. Remember, its important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. They can provide personalized recommendations and monitor your progress to ensure optimal blood pressure control. 9. Limit processed foods: Processed and packaged foods often contain high levels of sodium, added sugars, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to high blood pressure. Opt for fresh, whole foods whenever possible and read food labels to make informed choices. 10. Increase potassium intake: Consuming foods rich in potassium can help lower blood pressure. Good sources include fruits like bananas, oranges, and avocados, as well as vegetables like spinach, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes. 11. Monitor blood pressure regularly: Keep track of your blood pressure readings at home using a home blood pressure monitor. Regular monitoring can help you and your doctor assess the effectiveness of your lifestyle modifications and medications. 12. Limit alcohol consumption: While moderate alcohol consumption may have some health benefits, excessive drinking can raise blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, its best to limit alcohol intake or avoid it altogether. 13. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep and sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, can contribute to high blood pressure. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night and seek treatment if you suspect you have a sleep disorder. 14. Manage underlying health conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, and high cholesterol, can contribute to high blood pressure. Properly managing these conditions through medication and lifestyle changes can help control blood pressure. 15. Reduce stress: Chronic stress can have a negative impact on blood pressure. Engage in activities that help you relax and unwind, such as spending time in nature, practising mindfulness or meditation, listening to calming music, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy. 16. Complementary therapies: Some people find complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, yoga, or biofeedback, helpful in managing their blood pressure. While these approaches may not work for everyone, they can be worth exploring with the guidance of a qualified practitioner. 17. Limit added sugars: Consuming excessive amounts of added sugars can contribute to high blood pressure and other health problems. Be mindful of your sugar intake and try to reduce the consumption of sugary beverages, desserts, and processed snacks. 18. Increase dietary fibre: Including more fibre-rich foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, can help lower blood pressure. Fibre has been shown to have a positive effect on heart health. 19. Limit saturated and trans fats: High intake of saturated and trans fats can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Replace these unhealthy fats with healthier options like olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. 20. Limit caffeine intake: While the impact of caffeine on blood pressure varies among individuals, it may be beneficial to limit your caffeine consumption if youre sensitive to its effects. Keep an eye on how caffeine affects your blood pressure and adjust accordingly. 21. Stay hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day can help maintain healthy blood pressure levels. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day, or more if youre physically active or in a hot climate. 22. Consider dietary supplements: Certain dietary supplements, such as garlic extract, fish oil, and coenzyme Q10, have been studied for their potential blood pressure-lowering effects. However, its important to consult with your doctor before starting any supplements to ensure they are safe and appropriate for you. 23. Engage in relaxation techniques: Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery, can help lower stress levels and subsequently reduce blood pressure. 24. Follow a salt-restricted diet: Reducing your sodium (salt) intake can help lower blood pressure. Limit the use of table salt and avoid high-sodium processed foods. Instead, flavour your meals with herbs, spices, and other salt-free seasonings. 25. Monitor your alcohol intake: Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation, which means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. 26. Engage in regular physical activity: Regular exercise can have a significant impact on blood pressure. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Find activities you enjoy, such as walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing, and make them a regular part of your routine. 27.

Be mindful of portion sizes when eating meals and snacks, and listen to your bodys hunger and fullness cues. 28. Seek support: Making lifestyle changes can be challenging, so its helpful to seek support from friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your goals and progress with others can provide encouragement and accountability. 29. Follow medication instructions: If your doctor has prescribed medication to lower your blood pressure, its important to take it as directed. Follow the recommended dosage and schedule, and dont stop taking your medication without consulting your healthcare provider. 30. Regularly check your blood pressure: Monitoring your blood pressure regularly at home can help you track your progress and ensure that your lifestyle modifications and medications are effectively managing your blood pressure. Keep a record of your readings and share them with your healthcare provider during check-ups. 31. Manage your overall health: Taking care of your overall health can indirectly contribute to blood pressure control. This includes managing stress, getting vaccinated, managing chronic conditions like diabetes, and staying up to date with recommended screenings and medical appointments. 32. Educate yourself: Learn more about high blood pressure, its causes, and how lifestyle changes can help manage it. Understand the potential risks and complications associated with high blood pressure, and empower yourself with the knowledge to make informed decisions about your health. 33. Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Engaging in activities that promote relaxation, such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga, can help reduce stress levels and promote better blood pressure control. 34.

Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your overall health. 40.

Its that feeling you get when you listen and know what note is coming next, whether the pitch is heading up or down, how the rhythm is going to play out, etc. You may be wind up being wrong, but it counts as a pattern if it causes you to make predictions. (A sound sequence is noise when you cant make any predictions about it at all.) The tension can take various forms: breaking the pattern and returning to it, straining the pattern, refusing to complete the pattern, delaying resolution of the pattern, and/or finding ways to generate surprise within the pattern--ways that, in retrospect, are clearly part of the pattern but which, at in the moment theyre played, seem to violate it or move it in a surprising direction.  Some people add intent to the definition. Its not part of mine, but I understand the distinction. If intent matters to you, accidental patterns dont count as music. If your dog happens to bark in a way that pleases you, it doesnt count. To be music, the sound-sequence has to be patterned and created by a human (or group of humans) with the conscious intention of using pattern and tension to stimulate listeners.  That definition gets further specified by cultural fashions. Some people will claim that a specific sound sequence, while evoking a pattern, isnt music. An example might be someone rhythmically pounding a nail, even if the performer is intentionally trying to create a stimulating pattern.

It has “POS” or “+” on it, or it’s bigger than the negative terminal.Attach the other red clip to the positive terminal of the other car.Attach one of the black clips to the negative terminal on the other battery.Attach the last black clip to an unpainted metal surface on your car that isn’t near the battery. Use one of the metal struts that holds the hood open.Start the working vehicle and let the engine run for a few minutes.Try to start your vehicle. If it won’t start, make sure that the cables are properly connected and have the other person run their engine for five minutes. Then try to start your car again. If it still won’t start, your battery may be beyond help.If the jump works and your car starts, don’t shut off your engine! Drive around for at least 15 minutes to recharge your battery. If the car won’t start the next time you use it, the battery isn’t holding a charge and needs to be replaced. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

Full disclaimer, this is our Chrome extension. Guardio is an anti-malware program that removes existing malware from your computer and prevents new malware infections. It does this by blocking harmful sites, extensions, and push notification providers that try to insert malware on your computer. Our dashboard provides you insights on your past activity like how many harmful websites, information leaks, suspicious websites, search hijackers, and intrusive pop-ups it has blocked.After you install Guardio on Chrome, it will automatically scan your computer to look for unwanted popups, information leaks, harmful apps, and to check your overall system health. If it finds a problem, it will automatically remove the malware source. Then it will work in the background to keep you safe while you browse through the internet. 2. Manually remove malware from your computer. Chrome has a feature that allows you to scan your computer for malware and remove it. It’s great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections. To start scanning your computer, all you have to do is visit your Chrome settings and at the bottom of the page, under “Advanced” you’ll find a section called, “Reset and clean up”.Click “Clean up computer” and then “Find” to start scanning your computer. After it finishes removing the malware it finds, you’ll be asked to restart your computer. Do it and you’ll have completed the process. Again, this process is great for removing existing malware but it doesn’t help to prevent future infections so add an extra layer of security to stay safe while browsing the internet. Install a malware removal tool like Guardio and have peace of mind in knowing that it will actively work to protect you.

The discovery of radioactivity gave scientists another method to measure the age of ancient rocks. You see, rocks were formed with a certain amount of radioactive material incorporated — uranium or potassium-40, for example. This material decays at a very well-known rate, and it produces other elements that are also very well understood. Uranium, for example, goes through a complex set of decays that eventually ends with lead. If you find a rock and you can measure how much uranium it contains, and compare that to how much lead it contains, you get a decent idea of how old the rock is. The oldest terrestrial rocks known to science measure about 3.8 billion years old, so Earth must be at least as old as that. But not all rocks formed on Earth. Scientists think the rest of the solar system formed at the same time as Earth, including the millions of space rocks zipping around between the planets. Occasionally a meteorite falls to Earth, bringing with it radioactive elements that have been decaying since the start of the solar system (and which haven’t been eroded by wind or weather). By studying the ages of meteorite material, scientists have been able to push the start date of the solar system (and therefore Earth) back to 4.6 billion years ago. As I said, there are numerous lines of evidence that converge on this date. It’s not just a number that was invented because it sounds impressively large. If it still sounds like “bullshit” to you, then I respectfully suggest that you take the time to learn how radiometric dating works, and form a deep understanding of how scientists build knowledge."," hate to answer a question with a question, but what is it about billions of years that sounds like “bullshit” to you?

How to write a good resume for North American employers? Listen up friends from overseas. I’m writing this for your benefit. I live and breathe resumes for a living. I’ve seen it all. You too can have a good resume. All it takes is a bit of work and refining your communication style. I’m also super blunt, I swear a TON and I use a lot of robust, confrontational expression. Don’t be offended. But do take my advice. Remove the word “involved” from your resumes. This is a huge issue if you’re from the Indian Sub-Continent. The cultural attitude is “you are a contributor on a team; subordinate to strong leadership.” That’s perfectly good. In the US, when we see that, we ask, “What the fuck does that even mean? Were you —like— involved by way of making coffee for the team? Did you clean their desks?” Never say that word again. If you did it, say what you did. Use action words. Use action words. Never say “participated” again. “I participated in daily debrief meetings.” Nobody cares what you participated in. How did you contribute to the meetings? Did you just sit like a wallflower and do nothing? Then don’t say anything. So what, you’re shy. That’s okay. Don’t apply for jobs where you need to be “not shy”. Apply for jobs where that’s okay. If that’s the kind of job you’re after, then they won’t need to hear you lie and pretend to have done otherwise. If you DID participate in the daily meetings, then say, “Led meetings from time to time, discussed blah blah blah.” Stop saying “we”. Nobody gives a shit about what your team did. They care about you. They’re not hiring your old team — they’re hiring you. If you did it, say you did it; describe what you did. Remember that admonition about using action words/phrases? Good. Glad you remember that. Don’t say, “worked in …”. Nobody cares what you worked in. Say what you did. “Achieved in stock audit percentages at 96% in a $50-million-dollar store” works way better than, “Worked in $50-million-dollar store.” Don’t say “responsible”/ “accountable”. If you were “responsible for supervising 56 employees”, then use the action sentence: “Supervised 56 employees.” If you were “accountable for delivering monthly status reports”, then say, “Delivered monthly status reports.” Stop using fluff words. Don’t call your experience, “Rich, deep Java experience.” One — you aren’t making pornography. You’re doing whatever it is you do for a living. (Which, I guess could be pornography. High five.) Nobody wants your fluff words on the page. Be curt and direct. Two — nobody wants to read a hundred-page resume that is fluffed with useless adjectives/adverbs. Other fluff words are “dynamic” – no you’re not. Stop saying it. In fact, just remove all adjectives and adverbs unless they are specific and measurable to the task you performed. Never say “I”. You shouldn’t be speaking in first person anyway in a resume. You’re not being graded for using perfect sentences with subject, verb thingamajiggers. Use action sequence statements. “Delivered 18 pizzas per day. Achieved customer satisfaction award three months in a row.” No strange colors or pictures. You don’t have to put symbols of all your certifications in the header/footer section. The resume should be mostly text, perhaps some bullets. No crazy shit. You’re not an artist (but if you’re an artist, go ahead and do the crazy stuff). Align the declension of your verbs, tense and other such words. Your current job is present. “[I] Make coffee. [I] Print TPS reports.” See, the “I” is implied. Just leave it out. Your past jobs are all simple past tense. “Planted rows of corn. Murdered kittens in barn. Hid bodies under sister’s bed.” Friggin spell / grammar check a hundred times. Have someone else read it. Seriously. Why do I even need to say this? If you’re sending your resume in the US, you need to change your language settings to US English (and vice versa in the UK or wherever else you’re sending it). We say, “specialize”, “color”, “program”, “labor” and “mechanize” (etc). Your spell-checking software should be updated accordingly. Do NOT be afraid to put “Mr” or “Ms.” (only “Ms”; not “Miss” or “Mrs.” given that the former indictates no marital status and that is nobody’s business) in front of your name. Why? Because if you’re from a part of the world where Westerners may not know the difference between a male or female name (or if your name conveys none — even in the west that happens), this will help alleviate using the wrong pronoun and causing embarrassment. If you are worried about gender discrimination in your line of work; then leave that off. Your call. If you did it, list it. If you didn’t do it, don’t say you did it. This cuts to the truth of the matter. Here’s an ugly stereotype American recruiters have of foreign resumes, in particular from India. This will hurt: “They’re all total liars.” One tiny mistake on your resume makes you a stereotype. I do NOT approve of prejudicial lazy generalizations — ever. But I work in this industry. I hear what my peers say. I read the LinkedIn posts. Don’t be a stereotype.[1] Shorter is better. Do you really need a six-page resume for your eight years of experience? This recruiter gives you permission to use a two-page resume or maybe —just maybe— three if the experience is diverse and extensive. If not, it goes in the trash. Does your job description of your most recent assignment honestly need a page and a half? I don’t believe you. Not for a second. You’ve got TWO pages for a resume or maybe THREE if you’re really super good. Unless you’re someone I desperately need, I refuse to look at resumes longer than two pages. Don’t bother. Impress the shit out of your recruiter and keep it short and sweet. [2] How do you do that? Stop sending stock resumes. Write a stock resume and then adjust it for the client in question. Your stock resume can be a hundred trillion pages for all I care. But you better pare it down and use the company’s lingo when you submit it. If you worked at Google or Facebook (pretty much the top of the pyramid for any developer) for two years as a contractor, you get ten bullet points to describe your experience. That experience —if the most recent one— should not take up more than a half page. Many of the things you do are implied if you’re a “Java Developer”. Nobody needs to know what magical tool you used. Stick with the really important success stories of what you did. Adjust your resume if you’re submitting it to a client that mentioned that super-dee-duper rare tool you used. If they didn’t ask for it, then assume that your resume will be the “appetizer” and your interview will be the main course. Keep it short and sweet. If you have 15 years as a Java Developer, you don’t need to list every single thing you did at every single job. List the most recent five jobs if you’ve been doing the same thing. List the technologies you touched (comma separated). List four or five successes. Then just list the jobs after that going back ten years. You’re okay to say, “I have 15 years of experience” but leave off anything from the list that goes beyond 10. It’s not an application for employment w/ background check. It’s a resume. Research stock US resumes. I find it appalling that in some countries people mention race, religion, tribe, etc. Do not EVER do that here. Ever. Never ever ever! Don’t ever send your picture. Nobody cares about your hobbies or community activities unless it’s relevant to the job you do. Even then, leave it out. Stop ending your resume with “references available upon request”. You’re not conveying new information and I submit they already know you’ll furnish them if asked.Additional details listed as numbers above [1] or [2] etc.: [1] I have a lot to say on this and I really do mean it when I say that this kind of generalization and racism disgusts me. One, it’s hypocritical. I know as a recruiter that all people lie; there are not perfectly honest human beings. When Americans arbitrarily decide that Indians are liars, they’re overtly saying, “Our lies are okay; their’s aren’t.” I don’t suffer that. But permit me to split some hairs so that you can (a) understand where this comes from (understanding is important) and (b) understand how to address it when you see and experience it. I’ve said this a billion times, there are few groups of people that I respect and adore more than Indians. Yeah, that’s a bit of reverse racism, but I mean this more culturally. There are some cultures that I like and some that I love. I have an awkward fascination with India. I want every immigrant to come to the US and be successful. So why are the lies that Indians tell different than the lies non-Indians tell? I’m going to paraphrase the director of an Indian contracting firm that I work with, who explained to me why it’s different. Per him, “In India, the only thing you can trust, that consistently works for you is family. Companies and government, people you don’t know and organizations are all out to fuck you. They are corrupt. Some of them are so totally corrupt that they create a system whereby lying to them balances the equation. Why be honest with them, if they are working to fuck you over? Indians bring that value to the US without realizing that while there are certainly organizations that are corrupt and will fuck you over here, it’s nothing like the way it is in India. So in their heads, it’s okay to lie to get ahead even if it means creating totally fraudulent resumes.” What are the best typefaces to use in a resume?[2] Shorter is better? Okay, I allowed a three page resume here because it was really good, it was diverse and it would be really hard to shorten it to two pages and express what this lady has done (all personal details have been changed). A three or four page resume is not —honestly— a kiss of death. But it can be. I’m not double-talking here. Stick with two unless you have the length of history and chops to make it three, but please … no more than that.  ","A selection of answers:     I’m including some updates in this answer.

How to write a good resume for North American employers? Listen up friends from overseas. I’m writing this for your benefit. I live and breathe resumes for a living. I’ve seen it all. You too can have a good resume. All it takes is a bit of work and refining your communication style. I’m also super blunt, I swear a TON and I use a lot of robust, confrontational expression. Don’t be offended. But do take my advice. Remove the word “involved” from your resumes. This is a huge issue if you’re from the Indian Sub-Continent. The cultural attitude is “you are a contributor on a team; subordinate to strong leadership.” That’s perfectly good. In the US, when we see that, we ask, “What the fuck does that even mean? Were you —like— involved by way of making coffee for the team? Did you clean their desks?” Never say that word again. If you did it, say what you did. Use action words. Use action words. Never say “participated” again. “I participated in daily debrief meetings.” Nobody cares what you participated in. How did you contribute to the meetings? Did you just sit like a wallflower and do nothing? Then don’t say anything. So what, you’re shy. That’s okay. Don’t apply for jobs where you need to be “not shy”. Apply for jobs where that’s okay. If that’s the kind of job you’re after, then they won’t need to hear you lie and pretend to have done otherwise. If you DID participate in the daily meetings, then say, “Led meetings from time to time, discussed blah blah blah.” Stop saying “we”. Nobody gives a shit about what your team did. They care about you. They’re not hiring your old team — they’re hiring you. If you did it, say you did it; describe what you did. Remember that admonition about using action words/phrases? Good. Glad you remember that. Don’t say, “worked in …”. Nobody cares what you worked in. Say what you did. “Achieved in stock audit percentages at 96% in a $50-million-dollar store” works way better than, “Worked in $50-million-dollar store.” Don’t say “responsible”/ “accountable”. If you were “responsible for supervising 56 employees”, then use the action sentence: “Supervised 56 employees.” If you were “accountable for delivering monthly status reports”, then say, “Delivered monthly status reports.” Stop using fluff words. Don’t call your experience, “Rich, deep Java experience.” One — you aren’t making pornography. You’re doing whatever it is you do for a living. (Which, I guess could be pornography. High five.) Nobody wants your fluff words on the page. Be curt and direct. Two — nobody wants to read a hundred-page resume that is fluffed with useless adjectives/adverbs. Other fluff words are “dynamic” – no you’re not. Stop saying it. In fact, just remove all adjectives and adverbs unless they are specific and measurable to the task you performed. Never say “I”. You shouldn’t be speaking in first person anyway in a resume. You’re not being graded for using perfect sentences with subject, verb thingamajiggers. Use action sequence statements. “Delivered 18 pizzas per day. Achieved customer satisfaction award three months in a row.” No strange colors or pictures. You don’t have to put symbols of all your certifications in the header/footer section. The resume should be mostly text, perhaps some bullets. No crazy shit. You’re not an artist (but if you’re an artist, go ahead and do the crazy stuff). Align the declension of your verbs, tense and other such words. Your current job is present. “[I] Make coffee. [I] Print TPS reports.” See, the “I” is implied. Just leave it out. Your past jobs are all simple past tense. “Planted rows of corn. Murdered kittens in barn. Hid bodies under sister’s bed.” Friggin spell / grammar check a hundred times. Have someone else read it. Seriously. Why do I even need to say this? If you’re sending your resume in the US, you need to change your language settings to US English (and vice versa in the UK or wherever else you’re sending it). We say, “specialize”, “color”, “program”, “labor” and “mechanize” (etc). Your spell-checking software should be updated accordingly. Do NOT be afraid to put “Mr” or “Ms.” (only “Ms”; not “Miss” or “Mrs.” given that the former indictates no marital status and that is nobody’s business) in front of your name. Why? Because if you’re from a part of the world where Westerners may not know the difference between a male or female name (or if your name conveys none — even in the west that happens), this will help alleviate using the wrong pronoun and causing embarrassment. If you are worried about gender discrimination in your line of work; then leave that off. Your call. If you did it, list it. If you didn’t do it, don’t say you did it.

At about 2:00 PM I decided to go to bed as I had to work that night and read some before getting tired and seriously getting some sleep. I was in good health but had something upsetting happen at work the previous night and thought I had some heartburn. My Wife and kids got home from School and I asked my wife to get me some anti acid from the medicine cabinet, which I took. Instead of getting better the heartburn got much worse and started to spread into my jaw and left arm. I recognized these were symptoms of a heart attack and my son called the local Rescue. The pain quickly became incredible and it felt like there was a huge weight standing on my chest and someone was trying to pull my tongue out with huge metal pliers! The Rescue arrived and the EMT came in and the pain was horrendous to the point I couldnt even speak or even cry, but tears filled my eyes from the terrible pain. They placed me on a gurney and tried to wheel me out of my bedroom but my right arm as dangling and they were crushing it going through my narrow halls. That hurt badly as well but I couldnt speak or bring this to their attention. Everything over 5 feet away was blurry and they put me in the back of the rescue and tried to get vital signs and the pain was unbelievable! Then it happened and I was like in a smallish room, which was a pearl color and a Wise and Loving Being was there and told me not to be afraid. All my pain was gone and I felt great and very Loved. I said or indicated to the being (which for lack of a better term Ill call Jesus) I guess this is it huh? to which he responded, it may be. I said, Well I guess now Ill be judged? to which he responded Oh yes but the most difficult Judge of all, and it seemed I was immediately shown, almost like a movie my entire life. I wasnt a saint, but I was never malicious or harmed anyone intentionally and always tried to help others (Still do). I saw the smallest details of my life, warts and all the good things with the bad. It was obvious to me that I wasnt a bad person and the being of light said: You are the most severe judge as you know what you have done as nobody else and what youre intentions were. I came to the obvious conclusion I wasn’t a bad person, despite not being perfect. The being was very reassuring and we exchanged some words, which I can’t recall in detail, and I found myself going quickly down a long tube. I was at such peace and felt so good and free in every way. There were no limits to my thoughts and it was like sailing, I had the answers to all things, no fright or anything at all. As I reached the end of this tunnel or tube, I could see at the end a beautiful (descriptions fail me so please just understand how I put this) valley, with green grass and thousands of flowers and a lake with waterfall and a white city on a hill in the distance. As I got closer people started yelling my name and welcoming me! Many I couldn’t recognize, but others were past friends and family members! I was so glad to see them and wanted to join them badly. It was paradise and I felt like I was a part of all of them. Then I thought of those I had left behind. My Wife and two young children and the responsibilities I would have in their growing up. Yet I wanted to join my friends and family in the beautiful valley. The Beautiful “being of Light” was somehow beside me and said something to the effect that it was my decision, but shouldn’t I go back? I really didn’t want to, but my responsibilities to my family I felt were so important and to my friends, as well as people I didn’t know. I had barely decided and I felt myself go backward, away from my passed friends and family. I know I spoke more to the beautiful loving being but I don’t recall what I was told. All of a sudden I found myself in my body in the back of the rescue and the EMT was bending over me scared and trying to put a “nitroglycerin” tablet in my mouth. I tried to tell him “it goes under the tongue” but couldn’t speak as we arrived at the hospital. I was wheeled into the Emergency Room and saw the Doctors and Nurses quickly hook me up to the equipment and this Doctor said to me “We thought we had lost you” as they cut off my shirt and hooked up more equipment. Someone said to me “you are really lucky we just had a class on how to use this new clot buster drug!” Then things faded as I felt them work on me and I knew I was in pain and just certainly alive. My chest hurt and I had some broken ribs but over the next three weeks and intensive care I slowly recovered and was able to walk. The Doctors visited me and told me the heart attack did some damage to the back of my heart, and I should slowly recover my strength. In Six months I was back to work and feeling myself again, knowing how close I had been to death but wasn’t afraid any longer. When your time comes there is nothing to fear. But one warning I remember from the “Being of Light” and that is that Life is the greatest Gift God can bestow, and the one unforgivable thing is to take the life he created before it’s time. —————————————————————————————————— I knew when this happened it was a remarkable experience and I didn’t want to forget it. As soon as I was able in the Intensive Care Unit I wrote all this down so I never forgot it, and so I could share this with you. There was so much that I can’t put into words but this all is essentially true as it happened to me. There are so many things beyond us mere humans and our language.

At about 2:00 PM I decided to go to bed as I had to work that night and read some before getting tired and seriously getting some sleep. I was in good health but had something upsetting happen at work the previous night and thought I had some heartburn. My Wife and kids got home from School and I asked my wife to get me some anti acid from the medicine cabinet, which I took. Instead of getting better the heartburn got much worse and started to spread into my jaw and left arm. I recognized these were symptoms of a heart attack and my son called the local Rescue. The pain quickly became incredible and it felt like there was a huge weight standing on my chest and someone was trying to pull my tongue out with huge metal pliers! The Rescue arrived and the EMT came in and the pain was horrendous to the point I couldnt even speak or even cry, but tears filled my eyes from the terrible pain. They placed me on a gurney and tried to wheel me out of my bedroom but my right arm as dangling and they were crushing it going through my narrow halls. That hurt badly as well but I couldnt speak or bring this to their attention. Everything over 5 feet away was blurry and they put me in the back of the rescue and tried to get vital signs and the pain was unbelievable! Then it happened and I was like in a smallish room, which was a pearl color and a Wise and Loving Being was there and told me not to be afraid. All my pain was gone and I felt great and very Loved. I said or indicated to the being (which for lack of a better term Ill call Jesus) I guess this is it huh? to which he responded, it may be. I said, Well I guess now Ill be judged? to which he responded Oh yes but the most difficult Judge of all, and it seemed I was immediately shown, almost like a movie my entire life. I wasnt a saint, but I was never malicious or harmed anyone intentionally and always tried to help others (Still do). I saw the smallest details of my life, warts and all the good things with the bad. It was obvious to me that I wasnt a bad person and the being of light said: You are the most severe judge as you know what you have done as nobody else and what youre intentions were. I came to the obvious conclusion I wasn’t a bad person, despite not being perfect. The being was very reassuring and we exchanged some words, which I can’t recall in detail, and I found myself going quickly down a long tube. I was at such peace and felt so good and free in every way. There were no limits to my thoughts and it was like sailing, I had the answers to all things, no fright or anything at all.

Then the chemicals begin to break down as decomposition and new microbe life takes over. We are no longer an organism and become an environment for life much smaller than our own. We become like the rocks and trees, and soon rejoin the Earth. Want to know what its like to die? Ask dirt. Like the earthworm or an amoeba, it doesnt worry about dying, and neither will you. You, who cared so much about the afterlife, will soon no longer care about death. You, who a decade or two ago cared about certain TV shows or music, are a completely different person today. When youre an earthworm in terms of intelligence during death, youll no longer care about death at all. Are you still you? What happened to the you that was a kid so long ago? Every cell in your body is replaced every 7 years, or so. Every neuron is replaced one ion and molecule at a time. Thats nearly EVERY atom. Youve died already, many times, constantly. Youll die again and again until you devolve into an earthworm, then into dirt. This is what death truly is. It is not kind, and it is not unkind, but it certainly isnt eternal torture of pain or pleasure. It is what it is. Why not just appreciate the beauty of life for what it is while we are who we think we are. Like a brush of paint on an epic painting, we started at some point, and ended at some other point. We existed, isnt that enough? On a related note. It is my opinion that death should remind us that we are not gods. By our definition, a god exists always, eternally. Scientists ask to know more and be more of a person and embrace more of the world while they exist, knowing that it all goes away at some point. Those who are religious seek to exist forever, to seek eternity, is to seek being like a god. Isnt that a bit pretentious? Maybe death is a reminder from eternal forces that we are not like them, that we are not gods. Maybe if we live a good life and be a good example, the universe will bestow a longer existence. Think of Jesus and Newton. They set an example, and in a way, parts of them lived on in their name.

That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less. 2: Energy absorbed Of those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) → higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer → higher temperaturesMore droughts → More forest fires → more co2 → higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%. With the increase of energy absorption of 1.1% by 2.6 watts from 235 to 237.6 watts/m2, we can expect an increase in energy absorption by 3.3%. This is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans. With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes hundreds to thousands of years for newly thawn land to be solid enough to sustain roads, buildings and to become arable for agriculture. 5: What it is not One of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissions stay close to the surface and don’t enter the atmospherere.The only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%). Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2. So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years. That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air? This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:CO2 is a heavy gas, so it sinks in the atmosphere. - Great, that doesn’t change anything.CO2 lags temperature. - Yes, and as explained, it’s not the only cause of climate change (Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation, volcanic, geological activity), but those all remained unchanged while CO2 increased by 40%.Medival Warming Period - This was not a global phenomenon and a tiny temperature change of 0.2 degrees celcius.The temperature records were faked and temperatures in the past were pushed down and pushed up for the recent years so that it appears that the temperature changes were higher. - If you fact check, it turns out this gif just shows the differences for U.S. temperatures vs. global temperatures.Whither U.S. Climate?It was the sun. - No, the sun’s energy sent to earth decreased during the largest temperature increase during the last 200 years while CO2 increased by 40%. This literally only takes 1 minute to fact-check.You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking. This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them. Summary Earth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly. Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space. Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect. This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2. This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean. We can only try to slow down the cascading effect. All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.","here is only one fact that matters.

That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air? This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:CO2 is a heavy gas, so it sinks in the atmosphere. - Great, that doesn’t change anything.CO2 lags temperature. - Yes, and as explained, it’s not the only cause of climate change (Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation, volcanic, geological activity), but those all remained unchanged while CO2 increased by 40%.Medival Warming Period - This was not a global phenomenon and a tiny temperature change of 0.2 degrees celcius.The temperature records were faked and temperatures in the past were pushed down and pushed up for the recent years so that it appears that the temperature changes were higher. - If you fact check, it turns out this gif just shows the differences for U.S. temperatures vs. global temperatures.Whither U.S. Climate?It was the sun. - No, the sun’s energy sent to earth decreased during the largest temperature increase during the last 200 years while CO2 increased by 40%. This literally only takes 1 minute to fact-check.You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking. This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them. Summary Earth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly. Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space. Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect. This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2. This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean. We can only try to slow down the cascading effect. All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Look, people have this idea that scientists are in cahoots with each other to engage in groupthink, hoodwink the public, and get all that federal research money.

There is CO2 gas, the direct result of people burning things like fossil fuel, which has become a larger constituent of the Earths atmosphere than it was previously. 2.  The molecules of this gas are large enough to scatter heat back to the Earths surface -- so the Earth is less effective at radiating heat out into space.

The molecules of this gas are large enough to scatter heat back to the Earths surface -- so the Earth is less effective at radiating heat out into space.  Any molecule which has three or more atoms is large enough to scatter heat.  (According to a lecture I heard by the Nobel Laureate Sherwood Rowland, who has just left us.)  This heat scattering is called the greenhouse effect in popular and some scientific literature. 3.  Heat drives storms.  Storms are based on convection -- the movement of material based on its density difference compared to its surroundings -- which, in the case of the near atmosphere, is akin to saying based on heat -- since heat sets up great density differences.  The rock record shows a huge amount of extra weathering during the most recent previous warming period where the climate change happened as rapidly as in our current world (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum).  Cores drilled and retrieved show a hugely thick layer of sedimentary rock formed from weathered continental material correlated with the last global warming period.  That weathering was most likely due to storm activity.  Big storms are incredibly dangerous. Here is the paper Ive referenced about the increase in weathering during the last period of warming:Productivity feedback did not terminate the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) Here are some observations supporting the reality of global warming.  These are from the following NASA website:http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 1.  Sea Level Rise: Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century. The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century. 2.  Global Temperature Rise:  All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880. Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years. Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase. 3.  Warming Oceans:  The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969. 4.  Shrinking Ice Sheets:  The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASAs Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005. 5.  Declining Arctic Sea Ice:  Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades. 6.  Glacial Retreat:  Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa. 7.  Extreme Events: The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events. 8.  Ocean Acidification: Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year. There are lots and lots of things a person and communities can do to reverse this trend.  Personally, I think the easiest thing is for people to get serious about planting trees, while larger entities are sitting on their hands deciding what to do.  Trees sequester CO2, and I would think that a concerted effort has some good potential to reverse the global warming trend.  Here are some other things I favor: 1.  Industry might make more of an effort to use bio-based plastics and composites.  (Basically, making plastic from things like soy or corn oil instead of petroleum.  Growing crops pulls CO2 out of the atmosphere.)  Who wouldnt like to combat global warming by generating plastic to be thrown out?  Thats something wed all be good at doing! Here is a link to books on bio-based plastics and composites.http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bio+based+plastics+and+polymers 2.  Governments and science might start looking at creating extra ice in the polar regions, to create a heat sink, artificial ice fields.  This is feasible -- but the infrastructure to transport water for deposition (and later freezing) on high-latitude land in the Fall or early Winter would be significant.  The extra ice would serve to sequester some of the heat from the atmosphere in the Springtime, as the ice fields melt.  I do not know if it is possible to trap all of the extra heat in this fashion, but it is an interesting proposition.  Artificial ice fields would have a stabilizing effect on global temperatures. 3.  Stop burning fossil fuels.  These put extra greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as the endproduct of combustion, and this is a source of carbon which had been previously sequestered in the ground.  It is much better not to introduce any of this fossil carbon into the atmosphere -- and make fuels from plants or other means.  Research on alternative energy is progressing well.  Ive got a paper published on catching lightning for alternative energy.  There are many, many more untried or up-and-coming technologies and ideas for energy. 4. Do anything that strikes your fancy which will result in sequestering CO2 and other greenhouse gases.  Give more cut flowers, use wood which would otherwise be trashed for a project -- anything which pulls CO2 out of the atmosphere.   5. Put yourself squarely behind wanting to make this change.  It will happen if enough people get active.  Some solutions (like switching from petroleum to bio-based plastics) are technological -- beyond most peoples immediate reach.  But others, like planting a tree every two weeks, as weather permits, are reasonably achievable. Finally, governments need to put plans in place for how to deal with more catastrophic storm events.  Municipalities ought to have new plans drawn up, with contingencies for several major storms, back-to-back, and start training for this kind of emergency. Im not sure I like the tone of my answer -- much too didactic.  Forgive me!  Thanks for the question!","Global warming is actually happening.  Here is the theory behind it: 1.

That is not how it Continue ReadingThe best way I know of to find a girlfriend is to develop the qualities in yourself that make people want to be with you. Picture your perfect girlfriend in your head. Think about everything you would want in a partner. Now imagine her standing right there in front of you, in the flesh. Imagine that she has just walked up to you. Got that image in your head? Okay, good. Now answer this question: Why would she want to be with you? What qualities do you have that would make you a good boyfriend? If you cant answer that question, theres your problem. You do not “get” a girlfriend. That is not how it happens. Two people decide to be together when they each conclude that the other person would be a good partner to be with. A lot of horny, desperate guys spend a lot of time and energy thinking about what they want. “I want a hot girlfriend. I want someone sexy. I want someone cute. I want. I want. I want. I want. I want. I. I. I. I. I.” Okay, you know what you want. Now, what do you have that a woman wants? And no, the answer is not money or looks. Are you fun to be with? Are you compassionate? Are you secure and confident, not jealous or controlling? Are you open? Do you have integrity? Are you trustworthy? Do you treat women as people, not as things to “get?” |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Dude. I can definitely understand your emotions. But let me tell you my suggestion.I think you can relate to it.

How do you get one?Thats an intense area of focus. While getting a boyfriend isnt terribly difficult (you can just throw yourself out there and wait to see who smacks you bottom), getting one for a serious relationship is so much harder.One thing we have to recognize is that the term man-child is becoming more and more apparent as the times move forward. People, once they have grown up, dont want to be grown-ups; they still want to be kids. They want to have fun and play around, and make tons of mistakes, and not have to suffer for it... It makes people rash, irrational, irresponsible, and potentially easy to fail you if the going gets tough. Granted, this isnt the case for EVERYONE out there; but it does count for a majority population.So... First thing you want to do is IGNORE getting the boyfriend part... Thats the easy part (I dont care what you say, it is the easy part). What you need to do is to determing what a serious relationship is, to you. Being serious requires a lot of maturity; this is off-set by the aforementioned man-children... men-children? Would man-childs plural apply to the man, the child, or both? Hmm... Anyways... Its really hard to find someone mature enough to handle a serious relationship early in their life. It takes experience, and plenty of hardships, to help someone gain enough maturity and/or wisdom to be considered serious. So... Where do you start? I would highly recommend, hold off on the boyfriend until you reach your mid twenties. Yeah, thats a long time for many people... But for most, earlier than that theyll tend to want to focus on partying, or doing the things that only adults can do (clubbing, alcohol, drugs, etc.). This will rear its ugly head when you want help cleaning up after said party first-thing in the morning. So yeah, wait for a bit of time. The older the man, the more experience hes had... Therefore, you have a fairly good chance of finding someone with restraint enough to know when enough is enough.Next... Work. A man with an income is a very beneficial target; even more-so if you, yourself, are working too. Try checking out some of the guys in your workplace, as theyll be the easiest to relate to with regards to the world as a whole. Open up and chat with them, maybe check out some of the stuff they talk about... Who knows, you might like playing Grand Theft Auto: N.Korea. After a little socializing, you could make friends with some of them, and maybe even expand to hanging about with them after work.Finally... Personality. While ugly guys arent necessarily the cream of the crop, some of them can be very respectful people overall. So dont let the physical appearances get to you. Granted, there are some circumstances where it could be deemed... Difficult... To find the guy attractive; but dont give up on him. Perhaps offer assistance, or keep open the friendship barrier with the possibility of future prospects with him? Either way, try and get a guy who has similar interests as you... But is also someone slightly different. The reasons for this would be that people from the other sides of life from you are ones who can both help you to experience, and help protect you from, your weaknesses... In a controlled manner. If you cant swim, for example, having a partner who is a good swimmer can fill you with confidence that being near water wouldnt be too much of a problem if you accidentally fell in. Now do you see why I said to wait?Its painful for many women to wait, especially when they look at their biological clocks. Having to deal with menstruation, the everyday stresses and jealousy that can come from a life without that other half that some people just inherit from existence... You know the ones Im talking about. The first love forever types... Its strange, but it happens.Life throws some really weird curve balls at you... But so long as you take the time to allow both yourself, and your prospective boyfriend, some time to grow before committing... Youll actually be helping BOTH of you out in the long run. And if all of the above sounds like too much hassle and youre primarily looking for the experience of a serious relationship early in life... Just be sure that the guys youre checking out are smart and capable. Enthusiastic, progressive, accepting, etc. So many positive traits that can secure someones position. Just dont rush in; thats the immediate tactic to potential failure. I hope this helps, and good luck finding your White Knight :)","Hi there :) You want a boyfriend... For a serious relationship...

(The most important point) Lots of people, especially teenagers, miss this part. They are excited to hang out and make girlfriends and boyfriends. This is perfectly normal. But we should also know that relationships require a lot of sacrifices and can be difficult for many people. In short, relationships are not for everyone. (4) I’m self sufficient. I earn. I can cook, clean, and do almost everything. Moreover, I’m picky and I don’t normally like others doing my work. (5) Marriages can be risky. This is again from my experience. My uncle had a terrible marriage. His wife just wanted the child. After having the baby, she filed false complaints and divorced and took half of my uncle’s property with her. She literally destroyed our joint family and we broke into pieces. Marriage laws being highly biased in India, its especially risky if you’re the innocent husband. I am more scared, because I happen to inherit a lot of property from my maternal side (not bragging). The same applies if you’re a girl. You never know whether your boyfriend will turn into a demon after your marriage. The question asked about girlfriend, but I included this point because the fate of every such relationship is ultimately marriage. (6) There’s nothing wrong in being single. Our country has set up a motto in every individual’s life “Get married and have kids”. The population is exponentially increasing, and out world can do very well without some children. Jokes aside, being “single” is NOTHING to be ashamed of. This might sound stupid, but there are many such people who tend to have a girlfriend/boyfriend only to avoid the “single” tag. Listen to Beyonce. She has some tips for you ;). (7) There’s a WHOLE LOT of freedom in single life. (The second most important point) I don’t know about others, but in my life, my freedom is the MOST important thing in my life. I’m not particularly attracted to sex. My freedom, the ability to do what you want, when you want, where you want, without having anyone else to worry about, is truly a wonderful feeling and I don’t wish to sacrifice anything for that. There are girlfriends and boyfriends who are controlling. It often happens. In relationship it’s not always possible to have equality in everthing. Someone often has an upper hand in certain things.

My mother will probably be the happiest if i settle down and marry, but I know that I wont be able to visit them as frequently as i am doing now, and that is BOUND to make then sad. They’re old.

People are eating healthier and living longer so don’t waste your 20s being a complete f*ck up.Waiting until your 30s to “settle down” is a risky game. The playing field is a lot more difficult and less appealing once you reach adulthood. Thirty is the new 20 and by 30 you should want true stability, you don’t want to waste your adult prime going out on dates. A clear direction of focusAlthough your single homeboys are making the single life seem awesome (as it is), having a healthy relationship with a girl can enhance your overall stability. Girls are the driving force of male behavior. While your male counterparts are out spending money on drinks, spending countless nights masturbating, and sending texts to numerous girls who aren’t interested, you have better things to do. Having a girlfriend will allow you to direct your focus on things you enjoy most; such as your art, your career, or any other hobbies you may have. More goal-orientedAfter spending countless nights pillow talking with your girlfriend, you may begin to open up about your thoughts on the future and, more specifically, your future. Because you have someone who cares for you other than yourself, you now have a partner to join your “dream team” to combat each of your futures. A good girl will help support your vision and keep you on track. Let’s face it, girls are a bit more mature and have the ability to keep guys more grounded and focused. Now don’t get selfish, your job is to support her in her endeavors as well. A matured idea on “opposites attract”Your girlfriend is not going to be the same as you, in fact she may be the polar opposite. The two of you will come from a different culture, family and social background. Learning to work through problems with someone who is the polar opposite will enable you to increase your overall patience for diverse backgrounds on every frontier, not just with your girlfriend, but the world. A shoulder to cry onOkay maybe not cry, but at least one to lean on. So many mishaps occur for a guy in his early twenties. Whether it be getting arrested, getting fired from your job, or just being a complete idiot, you need that person around who won’t pass judgment and serve as your distraction from destruction. Girls are much more compassionate than your male counterparts. You’re wasting your time venting to them. They’ll just tell you to drink a beer and get over it. Money SaverSome would disagree, but having a girlfriend is more cost effective for your wallet. In no way am I implying you grab some sugar mama, or start using some low self-esteem girl for her bank account, but more of a “utilize your resources” type approach. In your early 20s, money is always the issue. Most likely both of you are pretty broke, but together you guys are pretty well off.With your long-time girlfriend, you can now split the cost of the following items: rent, gas, food, spirits and the hotel for your vacation(a vacation because you have the extra cash). And besides going on several dates with one girl is cheaper than going on several dates with several girls. More Adventures, Always having a “homie”I mean, who’s really going to go see “The Great Gatsby” with you? Surely not any of your male friends. Having a girlfriend allows you to indulge in so many other activities that you can’t do with your male friends. And besides, some things are more enjoyable if someone of the opposite sex is present. You can always count on your girlfriend to roll out with you in case your boys sell you out. Ability to become selflessFinally, this is the best quality to obtain from a relationship. We live in such an individualistic society and for millennials that means complete selfishness. Selfishness is an ugly trait and will only lead to bad things happening in this society. Obtaining the the ability to care about someone else other than yourself is all this generation needs to fix its problems. Having a girlfriend will, all in all, teach you that it’s not always about you!Modern monogamy can exist within this generation. Don’t let music, negative people, home wreckers, whores or womanizers stir you away from that idea. Your true loyalty to your girlfriend will increase your overall character. The ability to be loyal and commit to someone will even increase your overall level of respect other people have for you. In a generation where it’s so easy to cheat, and take the easy way out, your ability to be honest, commit and love another person will help you prevail in the end.","ere’s a few reasons why finding that special girl in your early 20s may be best: Get your life together in your 20s and not you 30sHaving a healthy relationship offers you consistency and stability.

Luckily, there are some very simple natural methods that will diminish or even completely stop your snoring. And the best part is, they take very little effort and are mostly free. 1.	Sleeping on Your Side Most people are much more likely to snore when lying on their backs. So try rolling onto your side. When you sleep on your back, your throat muscles push against your airway, which leads to snoring. Keep in mind that sleeping on your stomach may prevent snoring, but it isn’t good for your neck. 2.	Don’t Take Sleeping Pills If you think tranquilizing yourself is going to help you relax enough to stop snoring, think again. These drugs depress the central nervous system, as well as relax muscles within your jaw and throat; this means that you’ll be more likely to snore. It is particularly important not to consume sleeping pills and alcohol together. 3.	Losing Weight If you are overweight, particularly if you are obese, the added pressure on your airways will end up causing you to snore. 4.	Use a Mouth Guard Since one of the biggest contributors to the snoring problem is a lax lower jaw muscle, this is precisely where a mouth guard can come in handy. If you’re interested in trying this, simply talk to your doctor or dentist. 5.	Treat Your Allergies Suffering from allergies means you’ll probably find it difficult to breathe through your nose, and this will make it more likely that you end up snoring. Make sure to work in the use of local honey every day. A spoonful in chamomile tea before bed will help relax you and build up resistance to the allergens that make you stuffy. 6.	Don’t Smoke Smoking wreaks havoc on the respiratory system – give it up if you don’t want to snore anymore. 7.	Schedules Are Important Healthy sleeping habits contribute to the prevention of snoring, so go to bed at the same time each night and make sure that you get plenty of rest. Keep in mind that going to bed too tired contributes to your snoring problem.

Extreme dandruff which just wouldnt disappear , instead my dandruff just tended to rise when I used to apply anti dandruff treatment. Also I would like to state that you have found the right person to ask this question to. I will now tell you a really shortcut way for getting out as Ive been thru the same situation. You see your dandruff doesnt really depend on the water you drink. It will go on to stay the same. Now I advice you this procedure for getting out of this situation and believe me it will do honours for u. First of all go to a indian vaid and take some medicine to clear out your stomach. For example you can take softovac for regulating your stomach. And yes, please dont take kayam churn as it will cause unnecessary stomach aches without benefitting much. Secondly, go bald twice a year. Please dont hesitate doing this out of shyness from others as it is a matter of your health. I too used to go to college bald. Thirdly, when you go to village side market then you will find a anti fungal lotion named as “zalim lotion”. Please if you live in South india then the lotion may not be available there ( I actually never have been to southern states). You can try finding it online. If not found still then pm me ( and I shall courier you one bottle worth 20 rupees , now that I m writing so much) Also please dont apply any hair oils and shampoos when you go bald ( its often a misconception in our society that hair oil clears dandruff. Truth is that they just increase it) Now what you do is go bald and for first 15 days or so till your hair grow, apply zalim lotion on scalp via a cotton. It shall turn your scalp bluish with a little itching but dont worry, that will mean that its burning your fungal infection which you have mistakenly called dandruff( to get this story please read my other replies ) So I am advising you to just eat softovac in night which will regulate your bowel and use zalim lotion for 15 days once you go blad twice a year. You will get cured. And yes please dont consult any motherfucking dermatologist. They will just eat your money. (Many a problems , the western medicine just doesnt has a cure for) Please follow this and I suppose you will go totally dandruff free in second year.

Warm regards Siddharth yadav New Delhi","First of all mr suyash I am not copying pasting this answer for u from Google, instead I m writing my own experience. You see I too had the same problem in 2004. Extreme dandruff which just wouldnt disappear , instead my dandruff just tended to rise when I used to apply anti dandruff treatment. Also I would like to state that you have found the right person to ask this question to. I will now tell you a really shortcut way for getting out as Ive been thru the same situation. You see your dandruff doesnt really depend on the water you drink. It will go on to stay the same. Now I advice you this Continue ReadingFirst of all mr suyash I am not copying pasting this answer for u from Google, instead I m writing my own experience. You see I too had the same problem in 2004. Extreme dandruff which just wouldnt disappear , instead my dandruff just tended to rise when I used to apply anti dandruff treatment. Also I would like to state that you have found the right person to ask this question to. I will now tell you a really shortcut way for getting out as Ive been thru the same situation. You see your dandruff doesnt really depend on the water you drink. It will go on to stay the same. Now I advice you this procedure for getting out of this situation and believe me it will do honours for u. First of all go to a indian vaid and take some medicine to clear out your stomach. For example you can take softovac for regulating your stomach. And yes, please dont take kayam churn as it will cause unnecessary stomach aches without benefitting much. Secondly, go bald twice a year. Please dont hesitate doing this out of shyness from others as it is a matter of your health. I too used to go to college bald. Thirdly, when you go to village side market then you will find a anti fungal lotion named as “zalim lotion”. Please if you live in South india then the lotion may not be available there ( I actually never have been to southern states). You can try finding it online. If not found still then pm me ( and I shall courier you one bottle worth 20 rupees , now that I m writing so much) Also please dont apply any hair oils and shampoos when you go bald ( its often a misconception in our society that hair oil clears dandruff. Truth is that they just increase it) Now what you do is go bald and for first 15 days or so till your hair grow, apply zalim lotion on scalp via a cotton. It shall turn your scalp bluish with a little itching but dont worry, that will mean that its burning your fungal infection which you have mistakenly called dandruff( to get this story please read my other replies ) So I am advising you to just eat softovac in night which will regulate your bowel and use zalim lotion for 15 days once you go blad twice a year. You will get cured. And yes please dont consult any motherfucking dermatologist. They will just eat your money. (Many a problems , the western medicine just doesnt has a cure for) Please follow this and I suppose you will go totally dandruff free in second year. As regarding shampooing your hair, shampoo once every week and quickly wash off, dont keep shampoo applied for long. And please dont apply anything to your hair till your dandruff patches clear out from zalim lotion. Just keep your hair the way they are.

In medical terms, it’s known as seborrhea.It is non-contagious and is mainly caused due to factors like:Oily scalpScalp that’s not washed oftenAn yeast-like fungus that feeds on the oil in your scalpExtremely dry skinOr some skin conditions like eczema and psoriasisSo, how do you control your dandruff? Number 1: Make sure your hair and scalp is always squeaky clean Now this is especially for all times that you’re stepping out of the house, exercising, etc. Make sure you dry out Continue ReadingSo, first of all, dandruff is nothing but white flaky skin that often clouds your scalp and sometimes, also your skin. In medical terms, it’s known as seborrhea.It is non-contagious and is mainly caused due to factors like:Oily scalpScalp that’s not washed oftenAn yeast-like fungus that feeds on the oil in your scalpExtremely dry skinOr some skin conditions like eczema and psoriasisSo, how do you control your dandruff? Number 1: Make sure your hair and scalp is always squeaky clean Now this is especially for all times that you’re stepping out of the house, exercising, etc. Make sure you dry out your hair properly. Sweating is natural but excessive sweat can again lead to a build up of excess oil and impurities in your scalp and aggravate the problem. Avoid touching your hair and scalp with dirty hands. Number 2: Use the right anti-dandruff shampoo See, there are loads of over the counter anti-dandruff shampoos in the market, but the problem is most of these shampoos tend to dry out your hair too much and make it look lifeless and brittle. This is why it’s important to check with a dermatologist to select the right anti-dandruff shampoo that has the adequate concentration of ingredients to solve the problem without drying out your hair. Number 3: Focus more on healthy eating Your skin and hair condition are heavily linked to your eating habits. Eat foods that are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, protein, and biotin. Eat more greens and at least 1 fruit every single day and you will notice visible progress with your hair and skin in no time. Number 4: Avoid using oil Now this one may seem tricky especially in India, where oiling hair has been one of the oldest and effective ways of hair growth. But unfortunately, when it comes to dandruff, oil can be more of a villain than a friend because it can in turn lead to more dandruff. Oiling hair forms a layer in the scalp, restricting the natural entry of moisture. This can result in blocked hair follicles, which can further cause dandruff. Number 5: Maintain good hygiene Always make sure your pillow cases are washed and changed regularly and your hair brushes and combs are clean. Avoid sharing these objects with anyone else, to maintain the best hair hygiene. Number 6: Try the hot towel technique You can try this while applying any anti-dandruff lotions or masks on your hair. Take a big towel, long enough to cover your entire head. Submerge it in hot water for a few seconds, wring out the excess water, then wrap it around your head like a turban. This hot towel therapy will open the blocked pores in your scalp, letting the nutrients from the products you’re using for dandruff, penetrate well. Make sure to do this only once or twice a month, because overdoing it may result in dry hair. Lastly, do check with a dermatologist before using any home remedies like tea tree oil, lemon/curd masks, etc. for dandruff, because sometimes these can have contraindications, and cause more harm than good.","o, first of all, dandruff is nothing but white flaky skin that often clouds your scalp and sometimes, also your skin.

(Sorry, there’s not going to be a lot of pictures on this one like normal, It will be a while before I do Salmon again, my wife is mildly allergic to fish)I followed Anova’s Sous Vide Salmon with Hollandaise recipe not QUITE to the letter a few weeks after I got my machine.Sous Vide Salmon with HollandaiseThis simple salmon recipe transforms a regular salmon filet into an uber-delicious dish with Anova. Hollandaise is notoriously tricky; not because of the ingredients or individual steps to make it, but due to the timing. Thanks to sous vide, you can make the easiest hollandaise sauce. How easy? You literally toss all of the ingredients into a bag and cook it – don’t even mix it beforehand!https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-salmon-with-hollandaise-sauceThe fish itself came out better than I’ve ever had even at the best restaurants, and if you’ve ever made hollandaise from scratch (NO, not with a packet of powder) you’ll be amazed at how easy making up a batch of a delicate sauce like hollandaise is with Sous Vide. First, you dry-brine the salmon by generously covering both sides with salt and putting it back in the fridge for at least half an hour. While that’s bringing, preheat the water to 148ºF, 64.4ºC so you can make the Hollandaise, which takes 45 mins, so perfect thing to do while the fish is brining. For the hollandaise throw 8 Tbsp of butter, 2 egg yolks, 2 Tsp of lemon juice, 2 Tsp of water, a finely diced shallot, a pinch of cayenne, and salt to taste into a zip-lock bag. You don’t even have to mix it, you’re going to blend it later. Use the immersion method to remove the air from the ziplock…Leave a little edge of the bag unsealed, immerse the whole bag in the water, and let the water squeeze all the air out, submerge it until JUST the open edge of the bag is out of the water, then fully seal the bag and let it sink. Pro tip, if the Sous Vide water is really hot, you might want to do this in a large bowl or bucket of cold water so you don’t steam clean your fingernails while doing it. Let it sit in the bath for 20 mins, put it all in a mixing cup, stick an immersion blender in the cup, and blend it. There you go. HOLLANDAISE!!!! DONE!!!! THAT EASY, YES!!!! Now. Turn the Sous Vide bath down to match the temperature of how well done you like your Salmon: Firm, Moist and Flaky: 130 F / 54.4 C Very moist, Tender, and Flakey( this is how we like it): 120 F / 48.9 C Translucent and starting to flake: 115 F / 46.1 C Soft and buttery: 110 F / 43.3 C You can toss some ice in the water to bring it down to temperature quickly. Now Salmon is too tender for most vacuum sealers, so you want to use a ziplock bag with the immersion method for this. Rinse the salmon, and although the recipe says just toss it in the bag right after that with nothing else, I couldn’t. I Spread a minced clove of garlic on it, added a few pats of butter along the center, and placed a slice of lemon over each pat of butter, then sealed the bag and used the immersion method to remove the air. Let the Salmon sit in the bath for half an hour, Take it out, Sear it if you want to, I don’t think it needs searing, Pour some Hollandaise over it, and serve! You’ll never have a better piece of Salmon, I guarantee it!","Sous Vide. First things first though, pay attention to the salmon you buy, the fresher the better, and leave the skin on.

If you are going to make a vegetable sauce, cut up different vegetables.Fry over medium heat until the meat is brownedAdd 2 - 28 ounce cans of Italian plum tomatoes (break them by squeezing with your hand), deglaze the pan http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/deglazing.htm while stirring the meat and tomatoes, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutesMeanwhile boil a pound of Curly Lasagne noodles in a large pot of profusely boiling water, and when done strain in a colander. Spread the noodles out on a dish or anywhere you can so they dont stick together.Mix in a bowl, 1½ pounds fresh Ricotta, 1 pound diced or shredded fresh Mozzarella, a couple handsful of grated Pecorino Romano cheese and most of the meat and the sauce that comes with it.In a baking pan (mine is 9X7X2½) add some sauce on the bottom of the pan and two layers of the noodles, crisscrossing the layers over one another with the noodles bending up on the sides.Add a layer of the ricotta mixture.Keep adding a single noodle layer and a ricotta layer until you reach the top, making sure you end up with a noodle layer on top and crisscrossing each noodle layer from the last. Cover the top with slices of mozzarella and some sauce.Bake in 350° preheated oven for about 30-45 minutes or until the top becomes brown and the sides crisp (the best part).Plate and add sauce with remaining meat,and grated Pecorino Romano.Things I dont do when making my Lasagna...● I dont add salt in the pasta water because the Pecorano Romano is salty enough.● I dont add sauce between the layers of the lasagna because without the sauce the cut squares keep their shape. I add extra sauce at the plating.● I dont use the no-boil lasagna unless they are either Pastificio del Verdes or my own brand. ● I dont use the soft refrigerated sheets because they are too starchy.● I dont, under any circumstances, use the supermarket ricotta sold in plastic containers. For any decent meal you must use the fresh ricotta sold in metal containers. Of course, if its impossible to get in your neighborhood, you have no choice. To make Baked Ziti, the only difference is you boil Ziti pasta and mix it together with the ricotta mixture instead of layering it. All other steps are the same.","asnt sure what I was going to eat today, this question helped me decide. I lucked out that my camera was charged. I make Lasagna with meat sauce because I like the meat mixed into the meal, but you can substitute vegetables or nothing. Marinara will be fine. To make your meat sauce, heat a little bit of olive oil in a frying pan, add about a pound of ground beef and a pound of cut Italian sausage (I like to use the thin ones). If you are going to make a vegetable sauce, cut up different vegetables.Fry over medium heat until the meat is brownedAdd 2 - 28 ounce cans of Italian plum tomatoes (bContinue ReadingWasnt sure what I was going to eat today, this question helped me decide.

If you are going to make a vegetable sauce, cut up different vegetables.Fry over medium heat until the meat is brownedAdd 2 - 28 ounce cans of Italian plum tomatoes (break them by squeezing with your hand), deglaze the pan http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/deglazing.htm while stirring the meat and tomatoes, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutesMeanwhile boil a pound of Curly Lasagne noodles in a large pot of profusely boiling water, and when done strain in a colander. Spread the noodles out on a dish or anywhere you can so they dont stick together.Mix in a bowl, 1½ pounds fresh Ricotta, 1 pound diced or shredded fresh Mozzarella, a couple handsful of grated Pecorino Romano cheese and most of the meat and the sauce that comes with it.In a baking pan (mine is 9X7X2½) add some sauce on the bottom of the pan and two layers of the noodles, crisscrossing the layers over one another with the noodles bending up on the sides.Add a layer of the ricotta mixture.Keep adding a single noodle layer and a ricotta layer until you reach the top, making sure you end up with a noodle layer on top and crisscrossing each noodle layer from the last. Cover the top with slices of mozzarella and some sauce.Bake in 350° preheated oven for about 30-45 minutes or until the top becomes brown and the sides crisp (the best part).Plate and add sauce with remaining meat,and grated Pecorino Romano.Things I dont do when making my Lasagna...● I dont add salt in the pasta water because the Pecorano Romano is salty enough.● I dont add sauce between the layers of the lasagna because without the sauce the cut squares keep their shape. I add extra sauce at the plating.● I dont use the no-boil lasagna unless they are either Pastificio del Verdes or my own brand. ● I dont use the soft refrigerated sheets because they are too starchy.● I dont, under any circumstances, use the supermarket ricotta sold in plastic containers. For any decent meal you must use the fresh ricotta sold in metal containers. Of course, if its impossible to get in your neighborhood, you have no choice. To make Baked Ziti, the only difference is you boil Ziti pasta and mix it together with the ricotta mixture instead of layering it.

Heat a large frying pan with a lid and add in the oil. Add in all the vegetables, and cook for a couple of minutes, push the vegetable to the side of the pan and lightly fry the salmon for a couple of minutes, pour in the stock and cover the pan with a lid. 2. Bring the pan to a light simmer and cook for 3 – 4 minutes or until the salmon is just cooked through. Remove the salmon onto a plate and let the vegetables continue cooking until they are very soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, smash the vegetable with a fork until finely diced. 3. Break up all the salmon flesh and mix with the vegetables. Whisk the mascarpone with the egg yolks, the egg and season with salt, pepper, lemon zest and Parmesan. This should make a slightly thick paste. 4. Before you start layering the lasagne, put 50ml of fish stock (or keep some of the juice that you get from cooking the fish or make extra vegetable juice for this) into bottom of dish to make the lasagne moist.  5. Layer lasagne sheets with the vegetable, salmon, mascarpone and keep on doing this till all the mixture is used. Put some vegetable or fish liquid over the top. This lasagne should not be too high, just 3 layers. It should be an elegant not a bulky dish. Set oven at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and let the lasagne warm through gently for about 12 minutes. You might need to experiment with the amount of stock needed as different brands of lasagne can absorb different amounts of liquid when cooking. Keep an eye on the dish and add extra hot fish stock if necessary. 6. Serve sprinkled with the chopped chives or parsley. Delicious with steamed or grilled asparagus.

A guy’s smell is literally make or break (same as how I assume you wouldnt want to date a girl who smells of sweat constantly). Im not even exaggerating when I say this could be the different between being friend-zoned and getting a date. Im not saying to bathe yourself in Armani everyday, but just a few sprays on your neck and wrists should do it. 3.) Intelligence. Not saying you have to be Albert Einstein, but it would be nice to have a conversation about literature, philosophy, art and etc. every once in a while. Show that youre a cultured person. Show that youre interesting to talking with about something else other than football. 4.) Watch how you dress. I make it a personal mission of mine to avoid any kind of guy wearing a tracksuit. Some girls like that, I dont. Much like with smell, you have to please visually as well. Dont go out wearing whatever you found on your floor and expect girls to be drooling over you. 5.) Show interest. Even if shes the most boring person ever and you have to feign it. This will make her feel important and valued. For example you: “whats your favourite novel?” Her: “Oh, I dont really have a favourite but I quite like To Kill a Mockingbird.” You: “yeah, Ive heard its a really interesting book but Ive never got around to reading it. Whats it about?” Showing interest can be applied to even the most mundane thing, with very little effort on your part. 6.) Be polite. Treat people with respect. Now this isnt just if you want girls to like you, but people in general. But of course, no girl actively seeks out a douche-bag (at least none that I know of). Say please and thank you, dont be a smart-arse and if you like teasing, dont take it too far. 7.) Show that youre an interesting person as well. Now this will vary depending on your definition of interesting. To some, interesting is someone whos travelled to all 7 continents, gone sky-diving, met Obama and had to fight his way out of a room full of ninjas. For others interesting is simply what kind of books you might read, what sports you play, where youve gone on holiday and etc. 8.) Dont lie. As tempting as it is, dont. It will come back to bite you. Especially as a lot of teenage girls are really iffy about trust. If she smell a single lie, youve pretty much ruined your chances, no matter how big or small it is. 9.) Smile. Yeah. Its that simple. It will make her drop her guard somewhat, and youll seem charismatic and confident. 10.) compliment her. A lot of girls are insecure about themselves, so say something like “wow you look really nice today” or “your hair is beautiful”. Little compliments like this go a long way for some girls.","s a teenage girl myself, I will answer honestly: 1.) A sense of humour. Probably the most important thing.

By humour I mean witty comments, maybe a few cringey jokes and etc. 2.) Smell nice. I cannot stress just how important this one is. A guy’s smell is literally make or break (same as how I assume you wouldnt want to date a girl who smells of sweat constantly).

You could be the most attractive guy on planet earth, tick all the boxes that a girl is looking for, but if you dont have a sense of humour, youll barely last in a relationship more than a few months at best. By humour I mean witty comments, maybe a few cringey jokes and etc. 2.) Smell nice. I cannot stress just how important this one is. A guy’s smell is literally make or break (same as how I assume you wouldnt want to date a girl who smells of sweat constantly). Im not even exaggerating when I say this could be the different between being friend-zoned and getting a date. Im not saying to bathe yourself in Armani everyday, but just a few sprays on your neck and wrists should do it. 3.) Intelligence. Not saying you have to be Albert Einstein, but it would be nice to have a conversation about literature, philosophy, art and etc. every once in a while. Show that youre a cultured person. Show that youre interesting to talking with about something else other than football. 4.) Watch how you dress. I make it a personal mission of mine to avoid any kind of guy wearing a tracksuit. Some girls like that, I dont. Much like with smell, you have to please visually as well. Dont go out wearing whatever you found on your floor and expect girls to be drooling over you. 5.) Show interest. Even if shes the most boring person ever and you have to feign it. This will make her feel important and valued. For example you: “whats your favourite novel?” Her: “Oh, I dont really have a favourite but I quite like To Kill a Mockingbird.” You: “yeah, Ive heard its a really interesting book but Ive never got around to reading it. Whats it about?” Showing interest can be applied to even the most mundane thing, with very little effort on your part. 6.) Be polite. Treat people with respect. Now this isnt just if you want girls to like you, but people in general. But of course, no girl actively seeks out a douche-bag (at least none that I know of). Say please and thank you, dont be a smart-arse and if you like teasing, dont take it too far. 7.) Show that youre an interesting person as well. Now this will vary depending on your definition of interesting. To some, interesting is someone whos travelled to all 7 continents, gone sky-diving, met Obama and had to fight his way out of a room full of ninjas. For others interesting is simply what kind of books you might read, what sports you play, where youve gone on holiday and etc. 8.) Dont lie. As tempting as it is, dont. It will come back to bite you. Especially as a lot of teenage girls are really iffy about trust. If she smell a single lie, youve pretty much ruined your chances, no matter how big or small it is. 9.) Smile. Yeah. Its that simple. It will make her drop her guard somewhat, and youll seem charismatic and confident. 10.) compliment her. A lot of girls are insecure about themselves, so say something like “wow you look really nice today” or “your hair is beautiful”. Little compliments like this go a long way for some girls. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","By Trying to Impress Me You’re Attempting to Deceive Me - when you are trying to impress someone you are trying to act like the person you think they want you to be.

Get her off her script by asking off the wall questions and making statements. “What did you eat for breakfast?” “What’s your opinion on chickens - not the food - just in general?”Disagreeing With Her (Politely) - Don’t agree with everything she says, that’s boring and usually insincere. If she says something you disagree with just say so, it makes the conversation more interesting. The best is to be tongue in cheek with it.Showing her you don’t take yourself too seriously - Write on a napkin “I just want to let you know I make 100,000,000,000 dollars a year, so you better be nice ;)” and hand it to her and smile. She will burst out laughing. Teasing her a throughout the date will make her feel more at ease, and make her trust you more.Knowing when to be real - Joke through out the date, but no one wants to date a clown, so every now and then bring down the energy get real, then liven it back up.Lead - You don’t have to know where you are going just act like you do.Be a great story teller - tell her great stories, but focus on making the mundane interesting. I try to tell them a story about how I got lunch earlier that day. Later on as the date progresses, let the stories get more and more personal.Don’t be Overly Impressed by Her - I’ve dated girls who are diplomats, Harvard grads, models, etc. The times these dates went awful was when I made too big of a deal about their accomplishments/career.Have Boundaries - I don’t let people put their feet on my table. So when a girl comes over, if she does put her feet on the table I say “Don’t put your feet on my table” this is small but it communicates to her that I’m not a push over.Be Willing to Walk Away - I walk away from dates every now and then. Now that act doesn’t impress the girl I was on a date with, but it does make you a guy that girls want to impress. So always know your value, and if someone is treating you in a way you don’t want to be treated - always be willing to walk away.“Do I like her?” - Before worrying about how to impress her asks yourself “Do I like her?” “What has she done that impresses me?” “Do I like the direction her life is going?” “Do I like the person she aspires to be?”I wrote a book called “The Power Bible” click this link to find out more!

Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objectives as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don’t need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.Lead with your strengths. Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective.

Professional Summary Write a 4 to 6 line summary that describes your best professional accomplishments and capabilities. This is usually the first section to catch an employer’s eye, and must answer the question, “What do you bring to the table?” In your summary, use language from the job description to show how you can answer the employer’s needs and demands. REMEMBER : The employer is not at all interested about your CAREER OBJECTIVE. Instead, they need to know how your years of experience will help achieve their organizational goals. Skills Your skills section should be a list of 6 to 8 of your most relevant capabilities. Read the complete job description to see what the company needs, and match your most relevant skills to the description. Include a variety of “hard skills” (the technical qualifications you have for a job) and “soft skills” (your interpersonal talents, such as customer support). These are vital to highlight how your skills match the employer’s needs. Work Experience This section is particularly important and it focuses on showing off your work history. It should always include your job title, name of the organization, and your employment tenure dates for each job with your most recent job mentioned first. Under each entry, describe your responsibilities and achievements. Use industry-specific metrics, numbers, such as percentages or sales revenue to add tangible and measurable proof to your claims. Education Section. Your education section usually carries less significance than your skills and work history sections, although it can play an important role.

Recruiters spend an average of only about 6 to 8 seconds on each resume before deciding whether to invite a candidate for an interview. . The first 10-15 words of your resume are the most important; that’s how many words the average person can read in those 6 to 8 seconds. . The top one-third of your resume often determines whether a hiring manager chooses to keep reading or not. . Your professional / career summary is the section of your resume a recruiter is most likely to read. . Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for specific terms and key words. ATS search terms are mostly correlated to job descriptions. . Changing the wording of a keyword from the job description even slightly, for example, from “project management” to “project manager” could cause the ATS to eliminate you as it is a very sensitive system. . Many ATS cannot recognize abbreviations as common as “CIMA” “CPA” or “ACCA”. It is crucial that a job seeker needs to highlight any abbreviation in order to avoid any sort of elimination from the ATS. . Unusual fonts, spacing, and images can also throw off an ATS system and reject your application. . Typos can easily sabotage your resume. Recent studies from various employers showed that of the most common mistakes applicants make on their resumes, 48 percent are related to misspellings. Make sure you perform a final resume check before submitting. Conclusion Your resume is your passport to land a job in a new organization. The type of template you choose as you decide how to write a resume can help or hurt your chances of getting the job you want. Consider the expectations of your field, as well as your experience level. As you write your resume, working with a chronological format with standard headings and font choices will reassure employers with more formal corporate cultures that you are serious, well qualified, and ready to contribute. It will also clearly showcase your career trajectory at a glance.","esumes can be divided into five major sections.

You can start by playing at chess.com (also an app by the same name) or games.yahoo.com and try to play people with a score of 900 or lower. As your score improves, play people closer to your own score. When you play, watch what the other players do, and after a while you’ll start to recognize patterns. What pieces do they move at the beginning of the game? What kinds of defensive moves did they make when you were threatening to capture one of their pieces? What kinds of offensive moves did they do to take your pieces? Try to make mental notes of as many of these as possible, learn from them, and apply the good strategies to your future games. Once you’re comfortable with the basics of the game’s mechanics, then start reading up on basic chess strategy. Look up “chess openings” online and learned about the first 2 or 3 that come up, learn about “forks” and “double attacks,” and research basic endgame strategy. You can find all of these by doing your own searches on Google or by going through the chess.com app’s tutorial section which will cover all these things. (You might have to pay for one of their premium subscriptions, but trust me when I say their tutorials are really good). Keep playing a lot of games. Apply more and more strategies to your chess games as you learn them and continue to pay attention to what others and doing and learn from them, too. You should start to see your score improve by at least a couple hundred points. At this stage you’ll be ready to start thinking 2–3 moves ahead, anticipating what moves your opponent will make and already knowing what your counter will be. Thinking ahead is a painful, time-consuming process at first, but it will be second nature after your brain becomes accustomed to it and begins to recognize patterns without you even trying. From this point forward: wash, rinse, and repeat. Keep researching and keep learning, and start to play players who are 100–200 points ahead of you. Always challenge yourself. Once you’ve reached a score of about 1500 you should be in the top 1% of players on chess.com. This may take a couple years, but the satisfaction you’ll earn will be well worth it.","aby steps.

This is not what I did, but Im pretty sure I wasted a lot of time playing against people my level.  Another important resource is a chess engine. You should have stockfish downloaded on your computer to analyze your games. This is the amazing advantage people from this century have. You dont have to hire a grandmaster anymore to get divine analysis. You can also try to play against an engine to see what the highest quality of chess looks like. It really helps while youre not frustrated, but that will happen quickly. I used a chess engine from the beginning and it improved my understanding very quickly. The final resource Ill mention is looking at grandmaster games. Grandmaster games are not at the level of computers, but are often more instructive since theyre more intuitive and principled. Two good ways to view grandmaster games is through books and youtube commentary. I did not read any chess books as of now. But I did watch many youtube videos, which I found fairly instructive but mostly entertaining.  You should also try to join a chess club since its fun and often more productive than online. Blitz games online are not that useful in my opinion, although I play those all the time. My final piece of advice that worked well for me is to quickly avoid open/tactical positions and focus on playing positionally. You need to get to the point where you notice tactics where they exist, but that should not be your priority. Whats more important in my opinion is to be able to sense the dynamic possibilities of a position and feel where pieces should be placed. That feeling comes if you focus on it during your games. You should also try to understand what pieces are better than others and when.I recommend playing d4 to learn about positional ideas."," started playing chess at 18 and Im about expert strength now at 20.

It didn’t take much time for me to learn it but winning the game is another story. Everything depends on how you strategise your moves. All the pieces on the chessboard have their own rules and must move accordingly. For an easy read, let me explain how you can play the game: Chess is a board game with 64 black and white squares, and two players with 16 pieces each.

They form the first rank and are placed in front of Continue ReadingChess is a game that stimulates analytical thinking.

For an easy read, let me explain how you can play the game: Chess is a board game with 64 black and white squares, and two players with 16 pieces each. Of the 16 pieces, 8 of these are called pawns or guards. The latter is an informal term for new players to understand better. They form the first rank and are placed in front of the other 8 pieces. You need to start the game with them as they are your first line of defence and will help you bring down the opponent’s pieces. Both the players have black or white pieces, and as a rule, white makes the first move. As the game progresses, you take the pieces from your opponent as your pieces defeat them. You cannot bring down your own team, obviously. The other 8 coins or pieces consist of 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, a queen and a king. The most important thing about the pawns or any other piece is about the way they move. Pawns will only move forward, but while attacking, they can take the opponent’s coin diagonally. Once the pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it earns a higher position and can play as a rook, bishop, knight or even the queen. However, the pawn cannot play as the king. I’ve always felt that there is no real purpose of the king in this game, but yet, the whole game is about protecting him. The game is over when the king is taken. In my opinion, the queen is quite free to move the way she likes. That is important because sometimes, she is the last line of protection for the king after all other pieces have been taken. A checkmate situation arises when the opponent’s coin confronts the king, and his survival is compromised. That usually announces the end of the game, but depending on how you play, it is possible to come out of the checkmate and save the king. Even knights have a fair lot of liberty in their moves; they can jump over other pieces and only move to form an L shape. Therefore, this is another piece you should protect. Rooks can move in straight lines in any direction, even backwards, whereas bishops can move diagonally, forward or backwards! The only way to really learn the game is to play it. And I would suggest having an opponent who is sharper than you. It is okay to lose every game but observe how you can change your strategy. Chess is not about the coins as much as it is about your ability to move carefully.","hess is a game that stimulates analytical thinking.

The most iconic moment is probably the block against Andre Iguodala in 2016. Yes, you can talk about the 2011 nba finals, or the 2010 Eastern semi conference finals, but ask yourself, has Kobe Bryant ever choked in playoffs? If your answer is no, answer my questions below: Which player shoots 4 straight airballs in playoffs against the Utah Jazz? How well did Kobe Bryant played in the 2004 nba finals? How well did Kobe played in the 2011 western conference semi finals? What happened to Kobe Bryant in game 7 of the 1st round of 2006 playoffs against the Suns when he refused to shoot? Or tell me how did Kobe shoot against the Boston Celtics in 2008? So I turn the table to you, is Kobe really more clutch Lebron? Is Kobe really the real cold-blooded assassin, while Lebron is a “choke artist”? The second argument Kobe Bryant fans often use to discredit Lebron, is that Lebron cannot win with a SUPER team, while Kobe won all of his rings, especially the last 2 by himself. Thats a even more laughable argument than the first one. I ask Kobe stans, do you forget that Kobe played with prime Shaq in his prime? Tell me when has Lebron played with someone thats comparable to prime Shaq? And by the way, are Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum nothing to you? Do you think the Lakers will be able to win in 2009 and 2010 without Gasol, Odom and Bynum? And the argument Lebron played with more teammates with all-star selection is just nonsense here, I mean since when is all-star selection a objective measure to evaluate players? Did you know Andrew Wiggins is in the all star team last season despite a whole lot more players are more qualified than him? And what makes Kobe Bryant fans to believe that the more all-stars you get in your team, the better your team is supposed to be? If thats the case, can they explain to me why did the 2022 Lakers did much worse than the 2020 Lakers despite the 2022 having more big name all star players? Or can they explain to me why cant Kobe Bryant win anything in 2013 and 2004, despite the Lakers paired him with multiple all-stars? And please don’t tell me “Kobe never left his team and never tried to recruit anyone to play with him while Lebron did.” Kobe played with all-star teammates in his career, Lebron did as well. The only difference is, Kobe is fortunate enough that he didnt have to leave his original team to be able to play with other all-stars, but Lebron has to. And dont forget, Kobe Bryant requested a trade in 2007, and he had tried to recruit Dirk and Yao Ming in the past, lets stop pretending Kobe never asked for more help. Kobe Bryant is a all-time great, but, Lebron is just better than him, the only 2 things Kobe does better than Lebron is that Kobe is a more skillful scorer and a more ferocious one on one defender, other than that, Lebron James is both better and greater than Kobe.","ebron James.

Yes, he’s a scorer and expected to score, but his value comes from being more versatile. Even though he’s two inches taller than Kobe, LeBron has played really all positions except center. He’s never been considered a point guard, but he used to bring the ball up the court regularly and run the offense. Primarily he’s a 3, a small forward.

Up to 1959–06–30, there was only one legal foot in the USA, whose length was equal to (1200/3937) m (technically the yard was (3600/3937) m, the foot was 1/3 of that yard and the inch was 1/36 of that yard—the intent was to make the inch such that 1 m =39.37 in, as Americans had a propensity to try to make the metric units look like they were defined in terms of American units, making it easier for Americans to convert metric measurements to US customary units). Vladimir mentioned in his answer a 1593 act of Parliament that in essence set the mile equal to 5280 ft; this mile ended up being called a statute mile because it was defined by a legal statute. The US had the same relationship between the statute mile and the foot, namely a factor of 5280. The first problem was that the US and the English-speaking members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) had different definitions of the yard—the US in terms of the meter and most commonwealth countries having a metal bar artifact, except Canada had defined the foot to be 0.3048 m (a different relation to the meter than the US). This mismatch was regarded as undesirable and representatives from these countries agreed in 1959 to define the yard as 0.9144 m, so the foot became 0.3048 m, matching Canada’s already existing definition, shortened the US definition by exactly 2 parts per million, and lengthened the UK foot by a bit. The UK adopted this new definition and applied it to all derived units, including the acre as land area, effective 1964–01–01. The US adopted the new definition immediately and applied it to all derived units (including volume measures such as gallon) that were not associated with land measurement. (Thus the UK acre changed with the change of the yard but the US acre did not; the US gallon defined as 231 in³ changed with the change of the yard, but the UK gallon defined as the volume of 10 lb of distilled water at certain specified conditions did not.) The problem in the US was the existence of huge amounts of survey data that were based on the pre-1959 foot; though 2 parts per million change sounds small, it becomes very difficult to realign data points that are hundreds of miles apart. Therefore, the US retained the old foot, renaming it appropriately to “survey foot”, for anything related to survey maps and data. This meant that the rod, furlong, fathom (water depths showing up on maps), statute mile, and acre retained their pre-1959 size, and the statute mile stayed at 5280 survey-feet. The post-1959 foot became known as simply the foot (thus use of “foot” unmodified defaults to meaning the post-1959 foot of 0.3048 m); however, if there was any risk of ambiguity, the new foot would be referred to explicitly as the “international foot”. Thus, nominally (more about this weasel word later) 1 statute mile is: exactly 5280 survey feet and exactly [(5280 × 1200 / 3937) / 0.3048] feet, which is approximately 5280.010 56 feet. Now, there was also an adjustment to the mile to keep its relation to the adjusted foot with the factor 5280. This mile is known more explicitly as the “international mile” in parallel with the foot. There are 4 names for “land” miles (not counting nautical miles and some other really obscure miles): mile, international mile, statute mile, survey mile—the first two are synonymous with each other. Now it gets really complicated. The United States is a federal system, meaning the national (usually called federal) government has authority over all commerce (which includes weights and measures) that crosses state borders, whereas each state has authority for activities within the confines of the state. At the federal level and within most states the statute mile is synonymous with the survey mile, but supposedly in eight states all length/area/volume measurements have been adjusted to conform to the post-1959 definition of the yard and foot, so that the statute mile is synonymous with the international mile (and the acre is 4640 yd², not 4640 survey-yd²). The bottom line is:1 mi = 5280 ft = 1609.344 m (exactly) in all jurisdictions of the US;1 st mi = 5280 survey-ft = 5280.010 56… ft = 1609.3472… m at the national level and in most states,…………. 5280 ft = 1609.344 m in a few states.It is because of the two different values here for “the” statute mile that triggered my used of “nominally” earlier in this post and that I would have more about this—well, here it is. The use of “nominally” is because it is the definition and value used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and most, but not all, states have adopted. Most people do not care about this small of a difference—they would never notice. However, definitions need to be set up so that one definition covers everybody, including researchers and makers of precision equipment for whom this is a big difference as well as the common folk who do not care at all. I have actually worked in an application where the distinction between an international mile and the survey mile came up because an important error showed up in a simulation that mixed up the conversion factors between survey units versus international units and metric units. For the life of me I do not understand why so many Americans fight so hard to retain use of the US customary units and resist using metric units. They talk about how hard the metric system is and how easy to deal with the American units. When they do, I cannot help but think about issues with the number of feet in a mile, avoirdupois ounces versus troy ounces versus fluid ounces, how big is a bushel (which varies from state to state and commodity to commodity and often has little to do with the NIST definition), and numerous other oddities that make me wonder how anybody can think this is easier than the metric system. Then I remember Americans do not care enough—they live in blissful ignorance having a hard time remembering how many inches are in a yard and most really do not care that they do not know. It is very sad.","he answer to the question is far more complicated than one might think.

All this data shouts. Now is the time to invest in mobile apps. Before you can take advantage of this lucrative app marketplace, all you need to do is get your mobile app budget right. App Development Budget The app development process consists of several distinct phases. Each phase will take a piece of your app development budget. So, knowing the best practices for budget allocation per each app development stage will help you answer: “How much does it cost to create an app?” 1. Cost of Business Analysis in App Development Budget Your brilliant app idea needs verification, market analysis, and requirements documentation. An experienced mobile development team will ask you a myriad of questions to prepare an accurate app development quote. A good rule of thumb is to allocate at least 10% of the whole app development budget to the business analysis phase. Business analysts will participate in all phases of the app development project. Their job is to make sure that what you request: Is achievable and clear to coders Follows Apple’s and Google’s best practices Relies on the most effective technology stack Business analysis budget share in mobile app development cost: $1,200 to $11,000. Advice on how to trim the business analysis budget: Find other apps with the exact features that you want to replicate in your app. Clarify how this functionality will differ in your app. Provide UML diagrams for the development team. Discover best practices for business analysis on mobile apps projects. 2. Cost of Design and Clickable Prototype in App Development Budget As soon as the requirements document is ready, it is high time to start on the user interface. Flawless UI and UX are a must in today’s apps. So, you should be ready to cash out for the design. A lot will depend on whether you already have a brand book, but usually, design makes up 10-15% of the total app cost. Make sure you get a clickable prototype as a part of the deal. A click-thru prototype lets you check out the UX before the most expensive phase – app coding – starts. Some of the most popular tools for creating click-thru prototypes are:InVisionAdobe XDMarvelProto ioDesign budget in app development cost: $2,500 to $10,000. Advice on how to trim the app design budget: Grab some screenshots from the apps you like and explain why you selected them; Use stock UI elements provided by Apple and Google; Search for ready UI kits on the websites like ui8 and freebiesbug. Check out this collection of free UI kits for iOS and Android. 3. Cost of App Coding per se The app coding costs more than all other app development phases. Imagine thoughtful developers sitting in front of shiny iMacs writing strings of code. This image is only a part of the big picture. To make the image more real add daily stand-ups with the development team members. App development is a collaborative process: even a small app will need two or three team members. App architecture &amp; functionality development cost: $2,000 to $60,000. Advice to trim the app coding budget: Cross-platform development frameworks like Xamarin or Ionic can save up to thirty percent of the budget. The app must be simple for you to take advantage of these app development frameworks. Select your team or developer with care. For example, if you switch to an agency after working with a freelancer, remember that this will be a fresh start. Choose a development team that offers an agile app development approach with weekly deliveries. Use off-the-shelf mobile SDKs for some standard functionality, for instance: Chat SDK for integrating a chat module Twilio for voice &amp; video chatting or SMS verification Pushwoosh for push notifications Research what technologies your competitors use with App Explorer, SensorTower, or MightySignal. Never buy off-the-shelf app code templates if their developer doesn’t offer customization. Build an MVP version of the app with an online app building tool — there’s plenty of those — to test the idea. Don’t support older mobile OS versions, unless you are 100% sure you need to cover them. Make sure the requirements fully describe your app’s functionality. After coding begins, any new feature requests can make a dent in your app development budget. 4. Cost of Project Management in App Development Budget Project management is an essential part of the mobile app development process. Usually, a project manager controls the development process from start to finish. These efforts take up to 10-15% of the total app budget. Project management budget in app development cost: $1,200 to $12,000. Advice to trim the project management budget: You should never trim the project management budget, period. A project manager can make or break your project, but there must be a project manager on your project. Get rid of a project manager that does not respond within 10-24 hours. In most cases, this PM is not worth the money. 5. App Cost thru Lens of Development Phases Let’s calculate the software development cost of an abstract app based on the development phases that I’ve just described. $12,250 will be the minimal cost of our abstract mobile app. Yet, your mileage will vary depending on the features that your iPhone or Android app will have.

They cost significantly more than simple cameras with custom filters. Likewise, the cost of creating an ecommerce app will be high compared to a simple file manager. Business owners are always wondering how to create an app and how much it costs to build one. Or mobile app development cost or cost to make app or mobile app development cost or app development cost breakdown or app development average cost. cool! Here is a fantastic formula for estimating the cost of developing an app. Formula to estimate app development cost The formula for estimating mobile app development costs is simply to calculate the total amount of time the development process will take and multiply it by the hourly cost of the development team. 6 Key Factors Affecting Application Development Costs 1) Choose a platform Choosing a platform for your application is an early step in determining development costs. For example, the client chooses a hybrid app or a native app. Hybrid apps can work on multiple platforms. However, native apps may only work on specific platforms. android application Most business owners like to invest in developing Android apps that are widely used worldwide. However, the development of Android apps is higher than that of iOS apps. Java requires many lines of coding, which in turn takes a lot of time to develop an app. Also, a lot of time is spent in the testing phase. iOS application An iOS application built using programming languages ​​such as Swift and Objective C, requiring less code than Java. As a result, costs and development time will eventually decrease. Hybrid apps (cross-platform apps) One of the best ways to reduce app development costs is to use hybrid apps. Whats curious about this app is that one set of coding is enough for multiple platforms. It lacks a few features and functionality, but its a good option for entrepreneurs on a limited budget. 2) App Complexity The complexity of an app obviously affects the cost of developing an application. The top-rated app development companies have divided app complexity into three categories. That is, simple applications with basic functionality, average applications with some advanced features such as payment options, UI, UX, etc., and complex applications with advanced features such as AR, VR, APIs. integration, etc. As the name implies, simple app development costs are low, average costs are high for medium-level applications, and typical app development costs are high. 3) App function Choosing which features to include in your mobile application is also a necessary step in estimating the cost of building your app. The market has hundreds of features that make the app even more useful. The most commonly used features in mobile apps are user login, creative UI/UX design, screen orientation, navigation, geolocation, Google Maps integration, app security, chat/messaging, in-app purchases, database connectivity, AR/VR support, Its a push. warnings, advertisements, Multilingual support and integration with payment gateway apps such as Paypal, Sagepay, MasterCard, eWay, World pay, and more. So, as with all included features, you should choose the ones that match and play a significant role based on your business needs. You will need to invest extra money. 4) Application Hosting Application hosting is a very important step in making your app live for users to download via the Play Store and App Store. Its also part of the app development cost, which is very difficult for business owners to invest in. You need to choose the perfect platform that satisfies various parameters such as backend API requests, bandwidth per MAU, and bandwidth per user. It also helps you receive good traffic. 5) App maintenance Updating applications is essential because it reminds end users that applications are constantly changing based on user needs. These app upgrades lead to new features that require a large investment. In addition, App Bug Fixes is also one of the major factors that increase the cost. No application would function without bugs. In most of the cases, bugs will appear after publishing the application. So, you should keep checking for bug fixes. 6) App Development Team The cost of developing an app also depends on whom you are hiring to develop and cost to make a mobile app whether it is a renowned app development agency or a Freelancer. Large-cap firms charge a high amount as they have thousands of employees to build and app know very well how to create an app from scratch, whereas a freelancer or an agency of around 10 team members will charge a less amount as they will take little more time than large-cap companies. if you would like to know more about Cost to develop mobile application or App Development Cost USA or How much does it cost to make an app or How Much Does It Cost To Develop an App or Mobile App Development Cost or Mobile app development cost estimate or How much does an app cost to build app or development cost breakdown or average cost of app development or android App Development Cost or ios App Development Cost or how much does an app development cost, then reach our one of mobile expert to guide you to know more.

Is it $3000 USD, $15,000 USD, or more? To be honest, I dont know the exact cost of app development. There are several factors that affect the development cost of creating a mobile app. And these factors vary from application to application.

They cost significantly more than simple cameras with custom filters. Likewise, the cost of creating an ecommerce app will be high compared to a simple file manager. Business owners are always wondering how to create an app and how much it costs to build one. Or mobile app development cost or cost to make app or mobile app development cost or app development cost breakdown or app development average cost. cool! Here is a fantastic formula for estimating the cost of developing an app. Formula to estimate app development cost The formula for estimating mobile app development costs is simply to calculate the total amount of time the development process will take and multiply it by the hourly cost of the development team. 6 Key Factors Affecting Application Development Costs 1) Choose a platform Choosing a platform for your application is an early step in determining development costs. For example, the client chooses a hybrid app or a native app. Hybrid apps can work on multiple platforms. However, native apps may only work on specific platforms. android application Most business owners like to invest in developing Android apps that are widely used worldwide. However, the development of Android apps is higher than that of iOS apps. Java requires many lines of coding, which in turn takes a lot of time to develop an app. Also, a lot of time is spent in the testing phase. iOS application An iOS application built using programming languages ​​such as Swift and Objective C, requiring less code than Java. As a result, costs and development time will eventually decrease. Hybrid apps (cross-platform apps) One of the best ways to reduce app development costs is to use hybrid apps. Whats curious about this app is that one set of coding is enough for multiple platforms. It lacks a few features and functionality, but its a good option for entrepreneurs on a limited budget. 2) App Complexity The complexity of an app obviously affects the cost of developing an application. The top-rated app development companies have divided app complexity into three categories. That is, simple applications with basic functionality, average applications with some advanced features such as payment options, UI, UX, etc., and complex applications with advanced features such as AR, VR, APIs. integration, etc. As the name implies, simple app development costs are low, average costs are high for medium-level applications, and typical app development costs are high. 3) App function Choosing which features to include in your mobile application is also a necessary step in estimating the cost of building your app. The market has hundreds of features that make the app even more useful. The most commonly used features in mobile apps are user login, creative UI/UX design, screen orientation, navigation, geolocation, Google Maps integration, app security, chat/messaging, in-app purchases, database connectivity, AR/VR support, Its a push. warnings, advertisements, Multilingual support and integration with payment gateway apps such as Paypal, Sagepay, MasterCard, eWay, World pay, and more. So, as with all included features, you should choose the ones that match and play a significant role based on your business needs. You will need to invest extra money. 4) Application Hosting Application hosting is a very important step in making your app live for users to download via the Play Store and App Store. Its also part of the app development cost, which is very difficult for business owners to invest in. You need to choose the perfect platform that satisfies various parameters such as backend API requests, bandwidth per MAU, and bandwidth per user. It also helps you receive good traffic. 5) App maintenance Updating applications is essential because it reminds end users that applications are constantly changing based on user needs. These app upgrades lead to new features that require a large investment. In addition, App Bug Fixes is also one of the major factors that increase the cost. No application would function without bugs. In most of the cases, bugs will appear after publishing the application. So, you should keep checking for bug fixes. 6) App Development Team The cost of developing an app also depends on whom you are hiring to develop and cost to make a mobile app whether it is a renowned app development agency or a Freelancer. Large-cap firms charge a high amount as they have thousands of employees to build and app know very well how to create an app from scratch, whereas a freelancer or an agency of around 10 team members will charge a less amount as they will take little more time than large-cap companies. if you would like to know more about Cost to develop mobile application or App Development Cost USA or How much does it cost to make an app or How Much Does It Cost To Develop an App or Mobile App Development Cost or Mobile app development cost estimate or How much does an app cost to build app or development cost breakdown or average cost of app development or android App Development Cost or ios App Development Cost or how much does an app development cost, then reach our one of mobile expert to guide you to know more.

The majority of the population use various mobile apps as part of their daily activities. Statista says nearly 230 billion apps have been downloaded since 2021. As a result, the idea of ​​creating your own app is a smart strategy to pursue. But how much does it cost to implement a mobile application these days? The most trusted mobile app industry study provided the following estimates for app development costs and timelines: The average minimum app development project cost is between $5,000 and $10,000. According to Clutch, the typical cost of creating an app can be much higher. Median app development costs range from $25,275 to $114,300 for iOS app development at $100 per hour, representing 1,143 development hours, according to a Clutch survey. According to VDC Research, the average cost of creating an enterprise app is $140,000. According to Clutch, the total app price can go up to $500,000 for complex feature implementations. Regarding app development timelines: Over 80% of mobile apps take more than three months to develop. According to the Out systems Survey, 40% of apps are built over 6 months. Available app cost calculators show the price range for complex multi-function mobile apps from $200,000 to $350,000. If the app is configured with basic features, it will cost between $10,000 and $50,000. The most influential factors which determine the final cost to build an app are:App functionality and purposeVendor type and locationApp development processSize and level of development teamComplexity and number of app featuresBack-end infrastructure, connected APIs and integrationsComplexity of UX/UI designInclusion of additional branded visual elementsDevelopment approach (native, mobile web, hybrid, etc)Number of platforms to be developed (iOS, Android, web, etc)Mobile platforms and devices supportedOngoing maintenance planVendor type and locationMobile App Development Cost: Update for 2022The question is still open.

Our team has also created a detailed investigation on the cost to build an app that lists estimates based on widely used app features, design complexity, and software development stages. As a result, our conclusion supports the main findings regarding the cost to develop an app in 2022. An application with a core set of features costs upwards of $60,000, while the complex mobile app development cost starts at $300,000. The table below illustrates the range of costs to build an app with timeline accordingly. The characteristics of a basic app imply the creation of an app without any added-value. A basic app consists of just the core features necessary for the app to function, and includes a basic design and UI elements. The product is represented on only one platform; iOS, Android, or Web. An example would be a calculator app. The full product represents a mid-level app for one platform with more advanced features and design and with some unique qualities, making the app stand out from competitors. This way, the app is represented on one platform, for example - the loyalty app for McDonald’s. A complex app corresponds to an advanced product that provides a complete user experience on a few platforms. This app is an ongoing project with multifunctions and multi-users, extra UI elements, or features like online streaming, multi-user chats, etc.","pp development cost issues arise after you decide to bring your business online.

The BEST thing you can do, is to come up with an idea for something you would LOVE to use/make. The other route is to do random tutorials. Lets briefly break down these 2 options. 1) When you choose a specific idea, especially one you are passionate about, your eyes are on the end goal the entire time. You have direction and motivation that will stick with you until you see your project come to life. 2) Do random tutorials. Its a directionless way of going about things, and I would put my life savings on the line to say going this route is far more likely to lead to forgetting about wanting to make apps and quitting. Like signing up for the gym January 2nd, and the last day you ever go to the gym that year is January 15th. At first, while still working for this company using old technology, I was doing #2 in my spare time. I would find some highly rated tutorials, or read some Apple docs, text books, anything. However, I was never able to stick with this for long. It wasnt interesting enough to sustain my attention for more than a few weeks. I was doing this off an on for awhile, learning, and giving up when I became disinterested.  Then, an idea came to me that I was REALLY passionate about. Something I really wanted to see made, not to make money, but because nothing like it existed, I really wanted it for myself, and I also felt others would too and there would be a great market for it. As soon as I had an idea, I began to think about the requirements my app would need to meet, and to wireframe it. Wireframing is basically mocking-up the design of your application, with paper and pencil, or many online tools that allow you to drag screens out and place fake buttons, fields, images, etc. Now I had something TANGIBLE! My eyes were on the end prize. I didnt know any objective-c, Id never used a mac, I didnt know how to write a backend server, how to host it, how to interface it, nothing. There were a TON of obstacles in my way. But they never dawned on me. I simply PUT MY HEAD DOWN and WORKED! One thing at a time.  New languages Id never seen (objective-c, ruby [on rails]). New syntax. JSON, Web APIs, Completion Blocks, Networking, Push Notifications, In-App Purchases, Core Data, Multi-Threading, User Authentication, Keychain, Animation, and the list goes on and on. I knew exactly what I wanted for an end product, and I learned one thing at a time, and pieced it all together. So to get started I would say... dont just go out and do random tutorials. You NEED DIRECTION. I want to make an app is not enough detailed direction. Youll just end up doing a couple of tutorials, and not knowing exactly what you want will kill your momentum and inertia. You need to be able to say I want to make XYZ app. Its going to do A, and have B, and its going to be AWESOME!!. Once you know EXACTLY what you want, youll have a huge amount of inertia and momentum to carry your plan through to completion. No matter how daunting.

Look, when I was diagnosed at 21 at first I was relieved because I finally had an answer for what ailed me. I was sleeping all of the time, I was losing weight, I was in discomfort. It was hell. The diagnosis was an answer and depending on your personality it will determine how you live the rest of your life. At 21 youre immortal. You have a very limited scope of life and you never consider the consequences of your actions. After surgery my weight was 119 pounds (Im 59 and presently 185lbs if that helps you picture what I looked like). I remember a year later, when I was a robust 130 pounds my high-school sweetheart and I were shopping for engagement rings and she became noticeably embarrassed at my physical state when I was trying on a ring, and slapped me while saying in an exasperated tone Will you gain some weight?! Yeah, because I was HAPPY being 130 lbs. As you can imagine, our relationship ended soon thereafter. Most days my health was pretty good, and about once a year I’d get a flare-up. Prednisone seemed to be the answer at the time. If you’ve never been on prednisone, I can only describe it as a wonder drug but with bad side effects. Honestly, if it wasn’t so bad for you I’d never want to get off it; you’re gaining weight, you’re energetic, your disease is a distant memory. Wow, sign me up forever (except that it’s so hard on your system that it would eventually kill you). Nonetheless, for the month or so that I was on the meds, life was great!! Then slowly the weight would come off and I’d start losing my appetite, I’d feel ill and I’d have to go back on prednisone. Rinse-lather-repeat for the next 20 years. It’s funny, because I KNEW when I was going to get sick. I describe it as “my popcorn burp”. It sounds weird, and as far as I can tell, I’m the only person who describes it this way, but if I burped and got a certain taste in my mouth (which reminded me of a burp I’d get as a kid when I ate too much popcorn), I knew I was going to be sick the next day. Not sure exactly what it is, but when I get “that taste” I know my system is out of whack and I’ll be throwing up in the next day or two. Then I go back on my meds. It took me a few years to figure out that the key to maintaining my weight was to keep food in me for more than 20 minutes. Imodium became my best friend (and thank God Costco sells it in bulk). Here’s where I will say something that a lot of people will find weird (aside from the popcorn burping, obviously). I actually think that getting Crohn’s was, in a way, the best thing that ever happened to me. It totally changed my outlook on life. Suddenly I stopped sweating the petty things. I appreciated life more. I was grateful for days when the sun was shining and I felt good. I stopped worrying about things I had no control over. I started working out. Dammit, when I was on a good run, I was going to put some muscle on me, so that when I got sick, at least I’d have a good base to build back up on. Then suddenly from being the “sick looking guy” at 130lbs, I was healthy looking guy at 155lbs. I started dating again. Guess what? No one really cared about my abdominal scar. Oh, it’s a big thing to you, but not so much to anyone else. Sure there were setbacks. I almost died from a bout of internal bleeding once (I ignored the signs of having an ulcer… don’t do that, by the way. If you throw up and there’s even a speck of blood, get scoped and checked out), but the good days were outnumbering the bad ones. For some reason I got terrible bags under my eyes. Huge deposits of fat appeared. Not sure if the fat in my body got so confused as to where to go after so many highs and lows that it just decided to hang out under my eyes, but I had to get plastic surgery to remove them. My advice if you DO have this problem is NOT to get the laser treatment. I still have slight “raccoon” eyes because the skin around my eyes is permanently lighter. Fortunately, I come from good Scottish blood so I’m fair skinned anyway. Uh… what else?  Oh, heres a story Ive never shared with anyone; before I discovered Imodium, I had a bad bout of diarrhea. After surgery, I lost the part of the bowel that absorbs bile (lucky me), so I don’t just get the shits, I can get the “burning” shits. Yup, a stream of pure battery acid. I was in agony. Like, the WORST pain in my life. Far worse than stomach cramps that almost killed me right befor surgery. Suicide-contemplating pain. My solution? I had to draw a bath, spread my cheeks over the drain and shit directly in the swirling vortex. Hey, if you live by a river and it’s summer, then that’s an even better option. It’s embarrassing, but desperation makes us be creative. Shortly thereafter I never went anywhere with my little green pills. Aren’t you glad we’re sharing!! Okay, so about 3 years ago I started on a new immunosuppressant drug which is working really well for me. I haven’t touched Prednisone since and I’m now 185lbs. It’s nice to hear people compliment me on my arms for once in my life.But listen, we’re all different and some of us will have different paths. It’s been a struggle some days but I choose to look at it this way: “Some people have it so much worse”… It’s not a death sentence. I can still walk, run, work-out, date, and *gasp* even get MARRIED (granted, it happened when I was 41, but still). I think I’ve appreciated life far more than a normal healthy 21 will have ever done, and this is a gift. That’s how I chose to live life anyway. Take a month and feel sorry for yourself, and then start living life. Crohn’s disease is simply a challenge. Life is full of them. I don’t define myself by my disease. I know what I can eat and what I can’t. I’m good with two cobs of corn… if I push it and eat 5, well if I’m sick the next day, it’s my own damn fault (I still do it though because corn is soooo freaking good). Oh, and for some reason chocolate makes me feel sick, and so does peanut butter. That’s one thing that DOES suck. Man, I used to love Reese’s Peanut Butter cups!! *****Update***** The last year or two was a bit rough. Perhaps it’s to my body’s natural aging process but what had worked for me in the past was no longer working. I still have it better than many others but what had once become a minor annoyance was now making my life miserable. A few years ago my doctor suggested that I start treatment with Humira. It went from one injection, once a month to two injections a WEEK (and at $750 per injection with only 80% medical coverage it was expensive even though our plan maxed out at $2000 a year. That’s still 2k a year that we could have used elsewhere). Cost aside (what’s the value of feeling well?), the injections were painful and weren’t working. They would test my blood and my stools and the drug simply wasn’t being absorbed by my body. I developed anal fissures (yay… we’re SHARING) which when you combine it with numerous trips to the bathroom basically left me questioning the value of life. Man, I was suffering. Hang on… it gets better. So, my doc decides to start me on Stelera. We’re back to one injection a month which is delivered to my house in a giant Styrofoam cooler. I’m sure that the neighbours think I’m harvesting illegal organs. So far, so good. My quality of life is nearly back to what it was (I mean… I’m 54 so although I was hoping it would also cure my need for reading glasses, it’s dropped the ball on reversing the aging process). What I’m really getting at is that life is no longer tearing me a new asshole. The old one has healed up nicely. They keep developing new drugs. I remain hopeful that one day we’ll look back on this the same way we look at polio or small pox.","ve had it for 26 years. Whats it like?

It took me a few years to figure out that the key to maintaining my weight was to keep food in me for more than 20 minutes. Imodium became my best friend (and thank God Costco sells it in bulk). Here’s where I will say something that a lot of people will find weird (aside from the popcorn burping, obviously). I actually think that getting Crohn’s was, in a way, the best thing that ever happened to me. It totally changed my outlook on life. Suddenly I stopped sweating the petty things. I appreciated life more. I was grateful for days when the sun was shining and I felt good. I stopped worrying about things I had no control over. I started working out. Dammit, when I was on a good run, I was going to put some muscle on me, so that when I got sick, at least I’d have a good base to build back up on. Then suddenly from being the “sick looking guy” at 130lbs, I was healthy looking guy at 155lbs. I started dating again. Guess what? No one really cared about my abdominal scar. Oh, it’s a big thing to you, but not so much to anyone else. Sure there were setbacks. I almost died from a bout of internal bleeding once (I ignored the signs of having an ulcer… don’t do that, by the way. If you throw up and there’s even a speck of blood, get scoped and checked out), but the good days were outnumbering the bad ones. For some reason I got terrible bags under my eyes. Huge deposits of fat appeared. Not sure if the fat in my body got so confused as to where to go after so many highs and lows that it just decided to hang out under my eyes, but I had to get plastic surgery to remove them. My advice if you DO have this problem is NOT to get the laser treatment. I still have slight “raccoon” eyes because the skin around my eyes is permanently lighter. Fortunately, I come from good Scottish blood so I’m fair skinned anyway. Uh… what else?  Oh, heres a story Ive never shared with anyone; before I discovered Imodium, I had a bad bout of diarrhea. After surgery, I lost the part of the bowel that absorbs bile (lucky me), so I don’t just get the shits, I can get the “burning” shits. Yup, a stream of pure battery acid. I was in agony. Like, the WORST pain in my life. Far worse than stomach cramps that almost killed me right befor surgery. Suicide-contemplating pain. My solution? I had to draw a bath, spread my cheeks over the drain and shit directly in the swirling vortex. Hey, if you live by a river and it’s summer, then that’s an even better option. It’s embarrassing, but desperation makes us be creative. Shortly thereafter I never went anywhere with my little green pills. Aren’t you glad we’re sharing!! Okay, so about 3 years ago I started on a new immunosuppressant drug which is working really well for me. I haven’t touched Prednisone since and I’m now 185lbs. It’s nice to hear people compliment me on my arms for once in my life.But listen, we’re all different and some of us will have different paths. It’s been a struggle some days but I choose to look at it this way: “Some people have it so much worse”… It’s not a death sentence. I can still walk, run, work-out, date, and *gasp* even get MARRIED (granted, it happened when I was 41, but still). I think I’ve appreciated life far more than a normal healthy 21 will have ever done, and this is a gift. That’s how I chose to live life anyway. Take a month and feel sorry for yourself, and then start living life. Crohn’s disease is simply a challenge. Life is full of them. I don’t define myself by my disease. I know what I can eat and what I can’t. I’m good with two cobs of corn… if I push it and eat 5, well if I’m sick the next day, it’s my own damn fault (I still do it though because corn is soooo freaking good). Oh, and for some reason chocolate makes me feel sick, and so does peanut butter. That’s one thing that DOES suck. Man, I used to love Reese’s Peanut Butter cups!! *****Update***** The last year or two was a bit rough. Perhaps it’s to my body’s natural aging process but what had worked for me in the past was no longer working. I still have it better than many others but what had once become a minor annoyance was now making my life miserable. A few years ago my doctor suggested that I start treatment with Humira. It went from one injection, once a month to two injections a WEEK (and at $750 per injection with only 80% medical coverage it was expensive even though our plan maxed out at $2000 a year. That’s still 2k a year that we could have used elsewhere). Cost aside (what’s the value of feeling well?), the injections were painful and weren’t working. They would test my blood and my stools and the drug simply wasn’t being absorbed by my body. I developed anal fissures (yay… we’re SHARING) which when you combine it with numerous trips to the bathroom basically left me questioning the value of life. Man, I was suffering. Hang on… it gets better. So, my doc decides to start me on Stelera. We’re back to one injection a month which is delivered to my house in a giant Styrofoam cooler. I’m sure that the neighbours think I’m harvesting illegal organs. So far, so good. My quality of life is nearly back to what it was (I mean… I’m 54 so although I was hoping it would also cure my need for reading glasses, it’s dropped the ball on reversing the aging process). What I’m really getting at is that life is no longer tearing me a new asshole. The old one has healed up nicely. They keep developing new drugs. I remain hopeful that one day we’ll look back on this the same way we look at polio or small pox. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","Having Crohns on the worse days feels like a dozen rats are gnawing their way through your GI tract.

There are 5 types of acne scars, and each one requires a different type of treatment.Boxcar Scars It’s all in the name--they are box-like depressions on your skin. In most cases, you’d find this type of scar on your cheeks and jaws. While they may fade over time, they do not fully heal on their own. If you have boxcar scars, you either “sand down” the top layer of your skin (dermabrasion &amp; microdermabrasion) to make it look even or get fillers to remove the depression.

If you have boxcar scars, you either “sand down” the top layer of your skin (dermabrasion &amp; microdermabrasion) to make it look even or get fillers to remove the depression. Ice Pick Scars Ice pick scars are similar to boxcar scars in that they create depressions on the skin, but the ice pick is more obvious. It tends to be small and narrow, but they go deep into the skin. These are some of the hardest acne scars to treat. You won’t get much luck with dermabrasion. The only way to improve its appearance is by getting fillers that stimulate collagen production. And this is not a permanent solution. You’d have to get this done every 3-8 months. Rolling Scars Rolling scars have depressions with different depths. When they are clustered together, they can make your skin look uneven. Much like the first two, the best way to treat these scars is by boosting collagen production to improve the appearance of the pits. There are several ways you can do this--microabrasions, micro-needling, chemical peels, or fillers. Yes, the treatment seems intense. But these types of scars do not go away on their own. Whenever you see a touted at-home treatment that targets these 3 types of acne scars, run away in the opposite direction, they may end up doing more harm than good. Hypertrophic Scars The first 3 covered the atrophic scars, the pits, and depressions, but that’s not the only type of acne scar you can get. In some cases, you can get hypertrophic scars. They look like raised lumps, and their size tends to vary. Some may be exactly the same size as your acne, but there are times when the scar covers a wider area. These can present around your jaw, chest, back, and shoulders. And the chances of getting hypertrophic scars really depends on your genetics. Some are more predisposed to it than others. You can soften the appearance of the scar with a corticosteroid, but it would still be visible. If you really want to remove it, you may need to take more drastic measures like laser therapy, cryotherapy, or surgery. I’d consult with a dermatologist first before deciding what to do. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Now not all acne scars have to be a nightmare to work with. Sometimes all you are left with is a bit of hyperpigmentation which means the spot where your acne used to be is a little bit darker than the rest of your skin. This type usually heals on its own, but it can take up to 6 months before the scar truly lightens. There are a couple of things you can do to help the healing process. The first is to use a Vitamin C serum. Vitamin C is great for dealing with hyperpigmentation or dark spots in general. The second way is by adding chemical exfoliants to your skincare routine. AHAs and BHAs are the way to go. Prevent it from getting worse by making sure you apply sunscreen regularly and wear a cap when you go outside. Sun exposure only makes hyperpigmentation worst, and it doesn’t play nice with your chemical exfoliants. Among the 5 acne scars, there is only one you can truly resolve on your own. The other 4 require a professional dermatologist and regular maintenance. I hope that whatever treatment you decide to do, you do it the proper way!","Well, what type of scars do you have?

My experience with acne scars treatment was sometimes discouraging and [almost always] annoying. I chose to use honey. Raw, natural honey, that’s all.The first time this idea came into my mind was when I was walking home from school with a friend of mine who always had (and still has) perfect skin. By perfect I mean evenly toned facial skin with no blemishes, facial scars, freckles or whatsoever. She told me that the only ‘skincare’ product she applies to her face is honey - just a small amount of raw honey. And she doesn’t even have to do it every day - 2 or 3 times a week are enough, she said. ‘Yeah, sure’ - this was my reaction to her advice, I thought I would just neglect it like most useful things I used to neglect during my teen years. But I didn’t. When I got home, I checked if there’s still some honey left, I found a full jar and applied a very generous amount to my face. I forgot to mention that my friend told me that the longer I stay with the honey applied to my face, the better for my skin. However, I have used too much. And it started melting. And started leaking. And I got pissed at my friend because I didn’t realize that it was actually my fault. Anyway, after taking an emergency shower, I decided to never do this again. But I did, 2 days later. This time, using a very small amount of honey. I remember that it started stinging my face at first but then I got used to the sensation. It might have happened because of the red and irritated pimples, covering my entire cheeks and forehead. [Note that the first problem I needed to treat was active acne!] I have spent a bit less than 2 hours with this honey mask. I washed my face with water and saw myself in the mirror. I dont know if this was my imagination but I saw my active acne lesions less irritated, the redness was less noticeable, in short, I liked that. During the next 48 hours, my acne has started healing. After 2 more days, I repeated the same procedure but this time I stayed with the honey mask for about four hours. And after removing the honey, I could definitely see a difference. Redness was almost gone, the number of pimples has decreased. I couldnt see inflamed lesions on my cheeks or forehead. Long story short, I kept applying this honey mask 3 times a week, left it for as long as possible and within a month or two, my facial skin healed to the point that there were no signs of active acne. But I wanted to tell you about the post-acne scarring. It was brutal. I still can’t forgive myself for the constant picking. Seeing a newly formed pimple meant that I have to immediately pop it in order to get rid of it. Unfortunately, things dont work that way. Picking only spreads the inflammation, it does not promote healing and, above all, it leaves ugly brownish scars. So, OK, I cleared the acne but what about the scarring left? I decided to leave it as it is, as I was happy enough that I no longer have to deal with inflamed pimples. And kept applying the honey masks. But I started seeing visible changes in the scar tissue after 2-3 months. The damaged tissue was healing - honey provides useful nutrients for the skin, it was clinically proven to promote skin hydration and regeneration of the impaired tissue. The dark red marks became darker, then started to diminish in size, then peeled off. Also, there were deeper scars especially on my cheeks - well, they were flattened, much less noticeable than before. After a couple of months, they became barely noticeable and then disappeared completely. My entire treatment process took me about a year, maybe a year and a half, this was a great accomplishment for me because like most teenagers I was very conscious about my skin problems. And I m still grateful for the valuable advice my friend gave me. A modern alternative to my treatment are those scar removal creams, they are often available over the counter but, again, the progress will take time! And if you choose OTH products, keep in mind that you cannot apply them to open wounds! Hope my answer helps!

And she doesn’t even have to do it every day - 2 or 3 times a week are enough, she said. ‘Yeah, sure’ - this was my reaction to her advice, I thought I would just neglect it like most useful things I used to neglect during my teen years. But I didn’t. When I got home, I checked if there’s still some honey left, I found a full jar and applied a very generous amount to my face. I forgot to mention that my friend told me that the longer I stay with the honey applied to my face, the better for my skin. However, I have used too much. And it started melting. And started leaking. And I got pissed at my friend because I didn’t realize that it was actually my fault. Anyway, after taking an emergency shower, I decided to never do this again. But I did, 2 days later. This time, using a very small amount of honey. I remember that it started stinging my face at first but then I got used to the sensation. It might have happened because of the red and irritated pimples, covering my entire cheeks and forehead. [Note that the first problem I needed to treat was active acne!] I have spent a bit less than 2 hours with this honey mask. I washed my face with water and saw myself in the mirror. I dont know if this was my imagination but I saw my active acne lesions less irritated, the redness was less noticeable, in short, I liked that. During the next 48 hours, my acne has started healing. After 2 more days, I repeated the same procedure but this time I stayed with the honey mask for about four hours. And after removing the honey, I could definitely see a difference. Redness was almost gone, the number of pimples has decreased. I couldnt see inflamed lesions on my cheeks or forehead. Long story short, I kept applying this honey mask 3 times a week, left it for as long as possible and within a month or two, my facial skin healed to the point that there were no signs of active acne. But I wanted to tell you about the post-acne scarring. It was brutal. I still can’t forgive myself for the constant picking. Seeing a newly formed pimple meant that I have to immediately pop it in order to get rid of it. Unfortunately, things dont work that way. Picking only spreads the inflammation, it does not promote healing and, above all, it leaves ugly brownish scars. So, OK, I cleared the acne but what about the scarring left? I decided to leave it as it is, as I was happy enough that I no longer have to deal with inflamed pimples. And kept applying the honey masks. But I started seeing visible changes in the scar tissue after 2-3 months. The damaged tissue was healing - honey provides useful nutrients for the skin, it was clinically proven to promote skin hydration and regeneration of the impaired tissue. The dark red marks became darker, then started to diminish in size, then peeled off. Also, there were deeper scars especially on my cheeks - well, they were flattened, much less noticeable than before. After a couple of months, they became barely noticeable and then disappeared completely. My entire treatment process took me about a year, maybe a year and a half, this was a great accomplishment for me because like most teenagers I was very conscious about my skin problems. And I m still grateful for the valuable advice my friend gave me. A modern alternative to my treatment are those scar removal creams, they are often available over the counter but, again, the progress will take time! And if you choose OTH products, keep in mind that you cannot apply them to open wounds! Hope my answer helps! Thanks for reading it! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

As you pay off each card, snowball that payment into other cards. 2) Start with the card with the highest interest rate. Then do the same as above. While you’re doing that… Cut up your retail credit cards. Don’t use them again unless you get a kick out of paying 20% more for everything you buy. These cards are useless and the “rewards” you get aren’t even close to the amount of interest you’re paying. Keep one or two of your favorite cards and USE them. Pay them off each week/month, keeping a zero balance. I do this on Sundays. I transfer money from my checking to credit card each week. Each week is started with a zero balance. ProTip: Get a cash back reward card and pay it off each week/month. In other words, they’re paying you to use the card. Lower your debt to income ratio. The lower your total debt is compared to what you bring home, the better. Don’t max out your cards. The lower the amount you owe on your card compared to the amount you have available, boosts your credit.  IF YOU’RE ALREADY LATE ON PAYMENTS:  * Don’t use settlement companies. Ever. * Don’t use consolidation companies. Ever. * Don’t use Payday loans. Ever. * Don’t use title loans. Ever. Warning:  * If you have a savings account with a credit card you’re late on, the bank can (and will) take whatever you have saved. * If by some miracle you qualify for a consolidation loan from your bank, then make damn sure you close the other lines of credit…otherwise you’ll “find yourself” with double the debt you had before. * Rolling credit over to a new promotional interest rate card is dangerous. If you miss one payment, it can trigger a retroactive interest penalty and suddenly you have more debt that you did before the rollover.  Banks are the taxi cabs of personal finance. Extinct, expensive and bad service. Banks nickel and dime you while “storing” your money. You’re basically paying for awful service while they use your money to make money. Screw that. Use a credit union. They are owned by the members. Credit unions have competitive rates. They are usually easier to deal with. Credit unions are now everywhere.

But do take my advice because as a young adult I subscribed to monthly a credit monitoring service that included a credit simulator. This would enable you to understand what would happen to your credit score under various scenarios. It was the most useful $5/month I’ve ever spent. But before I get into the specifics, let’s first look at what makes up your credit score:The credit score has a number of assumptions that underlie your perception as a credit risk:Payment history: If you haven’t ever borrowed, you are an unknown quantity. An unknown quantity is more risky than a known quantity with a documented history. And you are less likely to miss payments in the future if you haven’t missed payments in the past.Amounts owed: Borrowing only a small proportion of what you’re allowed to shows that you’re disciplined and less likely to default. The specific thing they look at is your debt-to-credit ratio: how much you owe relative to how much you’re allowed to borrow. You’re considered a lower risk if you owe $10K on a total credit limit of $50K than if you owe $1K on a total credit limit of $3K.Length of credit &amp; New credit: if you’ve recently opened an account or several accounts, you’re less of a known quantity. You’re therefore more likely than people with a lengthier credit history to go on a shopping spree and not pay back what you borrowed.Between them, the factors I’ve outlined comprise 90% of your credit score. The remaining 10% is your credit mix. And here, I’m not sure what the rationale is. So, let’s not worry about it too much:FICO® Scores will consider your mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company accounts and mortgage loans. Dont worry, its not necessary to have one of each.Sorry… why does this matter again? Like I said, let’s not worry about it.Now, this question is about how to improve your credit score quickly. The answer is easy. You only have two options:Pay down/off all your balances.Apply for a credit increase on your existing credit cards. If you don’t borrow anything extra, this will have the effect of lowering your credit utilization ratio.That’s pretty much all you can do in the short term. There also one variation of the second point above that might work in very specific circumstances. You could apply for a new credit card. When you do, two things will happen:You will lose points for having applied for new credit.If you are approved, your total credit limit will go up, thereby increasing your score.If your initial credit limit on the new card is high enough, the effect on your score could be positive. But you have no way of determining what exactly your credit limit will be, and in most circumstances, this will be a net negative in the short term.Now, let’s say that you are not in a rush. You want to increase your credit score, but you’re willing to take your time to get there. How do you proceed? First, let’s look at my scores as of today:Let’s go with the lowest of my scores. What are the factors behind my score?Okay, lets dive in:I had a lot of inquiries last year. I knew I got a new car and I opened a new credit card. I also applied to rent an apartment. Those are all the inquiries I can remember. The different agencies treat what counts as a “hard” inquiry differently. For comparison, I have a higher score with the other two agencies because they only count the car loan and the credit card as inquiries. So, to them, I had 2 inquiries, not 4. I could probably contact Experian and complain, but I don’t care enough to. In any case, I wasn’t worried about taking a hit on my credit. Credit is meant to be used. A score above 800 does you no good. You get to look at it like a trophy, but you accumulate no points. So, when my score gets that high, I try to take advantage of some rewards on offer such as enough points to get a free flight somewhere.Again, not missing a payment, ever, is the best thing you can do for your credit. If you miss anything, it will take 7 years to fall off your credit report. Now, even with all those accounts I have open—and you’ll see below that I have a lot—I just don’t use very much of my credit. Of course, having more accounts open with a high credit limit also means that your credit utilization ratio will never be too high.I still don’t understand what the hell this credit mix thing is about. Maybe this is where the “you shouldn’t pay off your balance” myth comes from. They want to see that you don’t have a bunch of accounts that you never, ever, use, I guess? Meh. I don’t use most of my accounts. It’s never been an issue.Yup! I have a lot of accounts open, like I said. So, you’ve seen what makes up my score. How do we get it up? Why, with some credit score Viagra, of course! … I’ll see myself out. Let’s open the credit simulator and play a few scenarios:Making minimum payment over 6 and 12 months respectively.

Don’t take this step lightly.All right, let’s look at mortgages:Your score will drop if you refinance. And it will drop bigly if you are foreclosed upon.Okay, I think I’ll stop here.

Banana, pineapple, strawberry are good for your teeth, you can have them in diet. Also increase calcium in your diet. Lifestyle : Brushing regularly, flossing will prevent discoloration of your teeth. While smoking, using tobacco products, drinking cold drinks, will increase the discoloration. Ancient Remedy(Ancient India) : Add one small spoon of Turmeric with pinch of Rock Salt and one teaspoon of Mustered oil. Make a paste like consistency. Take it on your Brush, and apply on tooth for 2–3 minutes and rinse it off by lukewarm water. (It is recommended). Desi style(Indian remedy) : There is a effective for tooth whiting called, OIL PULL, To oil pull, put 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth and push and pull the oil through your teeth. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so you may need to wait a few seconds for it to melt. Continue the oil pulling for a full 15–20 minutes. It will kill the microorganisms in your mouth, pull out the particles causing tooth discoloration. You also use sunflower or sesame oil. Using the natural oil found in your region will give you the best result. Doing it will also detox your body naturally (you dont need to buy detox products). (I do it). Brush With Baking Soda: mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 2 teaspoons of water and brush your teeth with the paste. You can do this a few times per week. Its a mild abrasive that can help scrub away surface stains on teeth. Baking soda also creates an alkaline environment in your mouth, which prevents bacteria from growing. (Not Recommended). There are many many solutions for tooth whiting, I have just given some of them which have been effective to my patients earlier. You can also use Toothpaste specially designed for whiting.

From my personal experience, it is 70% diet and 30% exercise. By exercise I mean anything where you sweat and have to breathe heavily for long duration. Weight training further accelerates the fat loss.Keep it simple. If you try to do some fancy stuff, it wont last long. As a first step, avoid deep fried food, food with high sugar content, liquid calories like sweetened juices &amp; soda, etc. Reduce portion sizes of your meals and strictly monitor everything that goes into your body. Along with this start walking more wherever you can. Do this consistently for a month and you will see the changes for yourself.

All the crunches help you to strengthen the ab muscles, but not burn fat.To burn fat overall, you need to follow a healthy, nutritious diet and exercise regularly. This will create a calorie deficit and eventually your body starts burning fat for its energy needs.As said earlier, diet plays the critical role. As they say, Abs are made in kitchen not in the gym. From my personal experience, it is 70% diet and 30% exercise. By exercise I mean anything where you sweat and have to breathe heavily for long duration. Weight training further accelerates the fat loss.Keep it simple. If you try to do some fancy stuff, it wont last long. As a first step, avoid deep fried food, food with high sugar content, liquid calories like sweetened juices &amp; soda, etc. Reduce portion sizes of your meals and strictly monitor everything that goes into your body. Along with this start walking more wherever you can. Do this consistently for a month and you will see the changes for yourself.

It’s ALL ABOUT YOUR BODYS FAT STORING REGULATION. How the body stores or burns fat. This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food. They didn’t need to lower everything! Step Away From The Carbs: The science behind weight loss, the recipes to make it happen.

I was practically turning bald and my face covered with acne! My school friends made fun of me in every situation and my teachers disliked me for my lack of concentration and laziness in class. Yuucckkk!!! (I still shiver remembering those days!) Things turned so bad that one day I pledged to reduce my weight and remove all these negative things out of my life! I didn’t join the gym as I heard from somewhere that when I leave the gym, I would again gain weight as before.So, first I took control of all the junk, spicy food that i used to have. From street food to golguppe to biryani, I left all. I didn’t even have any aerated drinks, chips, french fries, burgers, sweets(including sugar), chocolates and what not! I craved for them but somehow I managed to divert my mind and explain the adversity of having them.Next, I downloaded some youtube videos of exercises on losing weight. These videos were mainly Zumba dances and exercises which consists more of dance and less of strenuous exercises (I love dancing! ;)) I can recall the videos were of PowerGirls Workout videos. Do check them out!Walk and walk and walk a lot! I used to attend my coaching classes in the evening which were 20mins by auto/rickshaw. I used to walk the whole route and even return on foot which took me 50mins in the whole journey. You should atleast walk 3-4kms everyday to stay fit.Have lots of fruits and drink plenty of water daily. I only used to have home cooked food made by my mother and every other food was restricted for me.Sleep well and most importantly avoid STRESS!! Frustration, anxiety and stress can drastically change your inner balance with body.Within 2–3months , I started seeing change in my body. I started losing weight(my friends were in awe!) and things gradually turned normal. After 7–8months, every single person I know couldn’t recognize me as they never thought I could bring such a change in myself. I lost around 12–13kgs and had a nice body(my friends were jealous of me :P) by then. So, the main part is you don’t need to follow crash diet or work-out 4hrs a day to reduce your tummy only to get it back within a few months! Do it in a healthy way, have patience, believe in yourself and you will definitely get the results. Good Luck! :) Hope this helps..

I dont recall how I learned this trick, but I have recommended it ever since. It works 100% of the time,  and only costs a couple of dollars, if that. Rubbing alcohol! Crazy, right? You can get it at the dollar store, but even at big grocers, its not very expensive. Theres a technique you need to follow, however, so you dont cause you kids any more distress than they are already suffering.  The first thing you want to do is be prepared to spend your day working on this. You need to strip your bedding &amp; wash it, setting it on a high heat dry. Vacuum off mattresses,  pillows, and furniture where you are likely to have contact with your hair, including you car seats, to be sure no nits,  (eggs), are left behind. Thoroughly inspect to be sure there are no bugs before remaking beds. I recommend putting alcohol in spray bottles and treating areas that you pre test, so not to ruin the fabric. Remove and treat stuffed animals, as well.  Now the kids. Find a WELL VENTILATED AREA!  Do it outside,  if you must. Have your child lean backwards, so you can pour the alcohol directly onto their hair, making sure to saturate it ALL. IF THEY LEAN FORWARD, THE ALCOHOL FUMES WILL AFFECT THEIR BREATHING! Although, the fumes dissipate quickly, its still not wise to have them leaning forward.  Once their hair is fully saturated, wrap it in a towel that you have wet in hot water, and wrung out. I left the towel on until it was no longer warm, or about 30 minutes. Remove the towel &amp; rinse hair thoroughly in warm water. At this point, you may see dead bugs and nits falling out of their hair. What happens is, the bugs all die from suffocation - I rarely saw a live bug after treatment. Also, the alcohol dissolves the glue that is used to stick the nits to a strand of hair. Its usually so difficult to remove eggs because they are shaped like a teardrop, with a little hook at the end. Bugs glue that hook to a strand of hair, and EVERY nit must be removed to ensure no re-infestation. This is typically the most tedious task, referred to as nit picking. This term is often used to describe someone who pays close attention to every single detail, good or bad, often bad.  Once the hair is rinsed out, time to nit pick. You should use a lice comb, as the teeth are super close together,  &amp; designed to catch the nits and slide them off the hair strand. If you dont have one,  you can still use a regular comb and manually pull the nits off. The good thing about the alcohol is that it strips all the grime out of your hair, making it super soft &amp; easy to comb! I had a paper towel handy, taking each nit and popping it on the towel, ensuring it would not hatch. Do the hair in sections, using rubber bands and hair clips to keep the cleaned sections away from the sections you still need to clean. This is easier working from the bottom, going up. Pay close attention to the nape of your neck,  and the area around/behind your ears. Make sure you get all bugs and nits, no matter how long it takes. If you followed all these instructions, you should be bug free by the end of the day!   Make sure you do EVERYONES hair in the house! Discourage sharing hats, hair ties, hair brushes, combs, or any other items that touch your hair. Remind your kids not to share with friends. If you happen to miss a nit that hatches, its possible to have another infestation. Because its cheap, and ready to use, plus makes your hair wonderfully soft &amp; shiny, it wouldnt hurt to treat everyones hair again in 7 days. Good luck!","When my own 2 daughters got lice,   I tried shampoos, mayonnaise &amp; other various products that were suggested to me.

Vacuum off mattresses,  pillows, and furniture where you are likely to have contact with your hair, including you car seats, to be sure no nits,  (eggs), are left behind. Thoroughly inspect to be sure there are no bugs before remaking beds. I recommend putting alcohol in spray bottles and treating areas that you pre test, so not to ruin the fabric. Remove and treat stuffed animals, as well.  Now the kids. Find a WELL VENTILATED AREA!  Do it outside,  if you must. Have your child lean backwards, so you can pour the alcohol directly onto their hair, making sure to saturate it ALL. IF THEY LEAN FORWARD, THE ALCOHOL FUMES WILL AFFECT THEIR BREATHING! Although, the fumes dissipate quickly, its still not wise to have them leaning forward.  Once their hair is fully saturated, wrap it in a towel that you have wet in hot water, and wrung out. I left the towel on until it was no longer warm, or about 30 minutes. Remove the towel &amp; rinse hair thoroughly in warm water. At this point, you may see dead bugs and nits falling out of their hair. What happens is, the bugs all die from suffocation - I rarely saw a live bug after treatment. Also, the alcohol dissolves the glue that is used to stick the nits to a strand of hair. Its usually so difficult to remove eggs because they are shaped like a teardrop, with a little hook at the end. Bugs glue that hook to a strand of hair, and EVERY nit must be removed to ensure no re-infestation. This is typically the most tedious task, referred to as nit picking. This term is often used to describe someone who pays close attention to every single detail, good or bad, often bad.  Once the hair is rinsed out, time to nit pick. You should use a lice comb, as the teeth are super close together,  &amp; designed to catch the nits and slide them off the hair strand. If you dont have one,  you can still use a regular comb and manually pull the nits off. The good thing about the alcohol is that it strips all the grime out of your hair, making it super soft &amp; easy to comb! I had a paper towel handy, taking each nit and popping it on the towel, ensuring it would not hatch. Do the hair in sections, using rubber bands and hair clips to keep the cleaned sections away from the sections you still need to clean. This is easier working from the bottom, going up. Pay close attention to the nape of your neck,  and the area around/behind your ears. Make sure you get all bugs and nits, no matter how long it takes. If you followed all these instructions, you should be bug free by the end of the day!   Make sure you do EVERYONES hair in the house! Discourage sharing hats, hair ties, hair brushes, combs, or any other items that touch your hair. Remind your kids not to share with friends. If you happen to miss a nit that hatches, its possible to have another infestation. Because its cheap, and ready to use, plus makes your hair wonderfully soft &amp; shiny, it wouldnt hurt to treat everyones hair again in 7 days. Good luck! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","This is because of re-infecting or poorly done treatments. You must treat everyone in the house and all fabric surfaces.

WASH &amp; DRY ALL CLOTHING IN THE HOUSE.Carpet, &amp; fabric furniture (like sofas and beds) can harbor nits(lice eggs) and bugs. Lice can live off a human body for a few days, eggs can hatch on any furniture within 2–3 weeks and the bugs crawl back on you. this is the reason why most box lice treatments tell you to do a second treatment in two weeks.Therefore vacuuming all rugs/carpets extensively. Using lice dusting powders and sprays are ehhh. I usually just avoided the carpet. (Like laying on it or sitting on it).My mother use to put our beds in the sun. I dont know if this actually worked to kill the lice. But most parents I knew did this. It might be because they didnt want is sleeping on the beds and getting re-infected.If you use lice treatment kits. Please get someone to help you use the nit comb. Theres a comb called the lice miester thats honestly the best nit comb Ive seen.When combing through the hair, do only very very small sections. Smaller than a pencil in width. Fan the hair as evenly as you can and use the comb from the scalp to the tips. (If its a metal comb- which are better- swishing them in very very hot water kills anything the comb removes. Comb the small parts of hair 3–5 times. And inspect it for brown or white nits. FYI brown nits are unhatched baby lice. White has already hatched. Brown nits are usually clustered around the ears and the base of the head (back of the head above the neck) cause this is the warmest part of your head. And the main reason its best to get someone to help with the combing. That being said, comb through all your hair. This process for someone that has shoulder length hair can be 5–8 hour process. You MUST COMB THE HAIR THROUGHLY! AND HAVE SOMEONE SEARCH YOUR WHOLE SCALP. this is because as much as we hope lice treatment kits work 100%. It might have missed 1 nit. And boom its back again. Once youre done with combing. If its a plastic lice comb. Toss it. If its a metal one boil it in water to sterilize it.Another method to killing lice is wearing a thick coat of vasaline in the hair for 3 weeks. Its a disgusting method and you can completely feel the little buggers struggle to live. But it smothers them. And once youre done with this type of treatment. Dawn dishwashing soap gets vasaline out. You also must lice comb your hair regardless of the treatment you choose to use. (Boys tend to shave their heads).Tea tree oil in my experience never “kills lice. They dont like it, so they tend to jump off and infect anyone else near you. That being said it can be used to prevent infection.I lived in a small town where these bugs swept through the town like a flu yearly. I use to babysit in high school and every other child I babysat had them at one point. Everytime. I would treat their hair, then my house, then my own hair. I stopped hugging people, I stopped babysitting and started wearing my hair up I stopped catching them.If you go to work and sit in fabric covered chairs.
