So just look at what type of food you eat and cut out refined carbohydrates, sugar and fructose and you will lose weight. No cardio, no running, no exercise. It’s ALL ABOUT YOUR BODYS FAT STORING REGULATION. How the body stores or burns fat. This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food.

This will turn your cursor into a little camera icon. Click on any open window, and it’ll capture the entire window for you. If, however, you want more options, then you can use ⇧⌘5 to bring up the screenshot options. This allows you to capture the entire screen, the selected window, or the selected portion. You can also save a recoding of the screen, ether in its entirety, or a selected portion of it, as well as decide where you want to save the file, if you want to set a timer or not, or if you want the mouse cursor to show or not.

First of all, you’ll need to create a folder to hold your screenshots; I have a ‘Screenshots’ folder in the ‘Pictures” folder. Then open up the Terminal app and copy the following, but do not hit ‘Enter’ just yet: defaults write com.apple.screencapture location Now drag your screenshots folder into the terminal app, and it should automatically fill in the folder’s path. You can now hit ‘Enter’. So, now we have decided where to save the screenshots, but we’re not done yet. By default, macOS will save screenshots as PNG files, which are lovely, but not terribly useful if you just want something simple to work with; for that, JPGs are much more useful. Changing the default file format is also nice and easy though, so let’s do that. defaults write com.apple.screencapture type followed by a space, and then type the relevant format suffix like I said, I use JPEG, so for me it would like like this: defaults write com.apple.screencapture type JPG Finally, we need to save the settings that we’ve just changed, and for that we ned the following command, again copied into Terminal: killall SystemUIServer And that’s it. You should now have screenshots in a useful format, saved in a useful location. But I’m not quite done yet. Before I go, I’ll leave you with four more useful tips, that will soon have you using screenshots like a pro: Tip: 1 When using the ⇧⌘4 shortcut combined with the spacebar to capture windows, you can eliminate the windows drop shadow from the screenshot by using Option-click instead of regular click. Tip: 2 When using ⇧⌘4 to grab a portion of the screen, if you misjudge the initial point of your selection, hold down the spacebar before releasing the mouse button and you can reposition the entire selection area. Tip: 3 When making a selection with ⇧⌘4, press the Option key before releasing the mouse button and move your mouse around to resize the dimensions of the selection area from its centre point. Tip: 4 When expanding a selection area with your mouse, hold down the Shift key to lock the dimensions of the area except for the direction that you are presently dragging in."," use screenshots a lot in MacOS, and there are a few things that I have picked up over the years, so I’m going to break this answer down into two sections; Taking screenshots, and using screenshots.

This will change your cursor to a crosshair that you can then click and drag to make your selection. When you let go, the select area will be captured. If instead you want to capture the entire screen, then you can use ⇧⌘3. If you want to capture a specific window, then use ⇧⌘4, but this time press the spacebar. This will turn your cursor into a little camera icon. Click on any open window, and it’ll capture the entire window for you. If, however, you want more options, then you can use ⇧⌘5 to bring up the screenshot options. This allows you to capture the entire screen, the selected window, or the selected portion. You can also save a recoding of the screen, ether in its entirety, or a selected portion of it, as well as decide where you want to save the file, if you want to set a timer or not, or if you want the mouse cursor to show or not.

This is with an Average Credit Rating.So if we dont exceed 30% of your monthly income, you will need a minimum income of about $7,550/month or $90,600/year.Now, there are so many variables in all of this, like different loan types, actual credit rating, actual location, actual home price, actual down payment, etc., but I think you get the picture. Other factors to consider which may require more income than $90,600, are your commuting costs, other debt, local cost of living, and local/state taxes.

I pickContinue ReadingOK, first Ill give you some info about CA home prices:Across all of California, the median home price is about $550,000. That means half of all homes are below that and half are above it.For just the San Francisco Bay Metro Area (9 county), the median home price is about $1,250,000. Whew, thats a stinker, huh!OK, now lets talk about what you can afford:Generally, the basic guideline is that you should pay no more than 30% of your monthly income on housing. Many Californians exceed that, but youre the frugal sort, so well stick with 30%.Lets go for that nice little home at $550,000. I picked Sacramento for the calculation (gotta have a Zip Code). Its just a short distance up the road from SF!So, youre going to need to dip into your savings account for your down payment of $137,500 (25% down).So your dream home mortgage is going to be Fixed, 30-year, at 5.25%, with a monthly payment of $2,265 (without tax &amp; insurance). This is with an Average Credit Rating.So if we dont exceed 30% of your monthly income, you will need a minimum income of about $7,550/month or $90,600/year.Now, there are so many variables in all of this, like different loan types, actual credit rating, actual location, actual home price, actual down payment, etc., but I think you get the picture. Other factors to consider which may require more income than $90,600, are your commuting costs, other debt, local cost of living, and local/state taxes. The median home prices are from Zillow and the loan calculation is from Quicken Loans. I hope that helps! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","California is about 900 miles North to South and 250 miles East to West. The Northern half is rainy and heavily forested.

If you want to manually select the area to capture, then the quickest method is to use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘4.

This will change your cursor to a crosshair that you can then click and drag to make your selection. When you let go, the select area will be captured. If instead you want to capture the entire screen, then you can use ⇧⌘3. If you want to capture a specific window, then use ⇧⌘4, but this time press the spacebar. This will turn your cursor into a little camera icon. Click on any open window, and it’ll capture the entire window for you. If, however, you want more options, then you can use ⇧⌘5 to bring up the screenshot options. This allows you to capture the entire screen, the selected window, or the selected portion. You can also save a recoding of the screen, ether in its entirety, or a selected portion of it, as well as decide where you want to save the file, if you want to set a timer or not, or if you want the mouse cursor to show or not. Now, this is where it gets interesting. By default, macOS will save your screenshots to the desktop, but, if you’re like me, and you hate a cluttered desktop, there is an easy way to change this. First of all, you’ll need to create a folder to hold your screenshots; I have a ‘Screenshots’ folder in the ‘Pictures” folder. Then open up the Terminal app and copy the following, but do not hit ‘Enter’ just yet: defaults write com.apple.screencapture location Now drag your screenshots folder into the terminal app, and it should automatically fill in the folder’s path. You can now hit ‘Enter’. So, now we have decided where to save the screenshots, but we’re not done yet. By default, macOS will save screenshots as PNG files, which are lovely, but not terribly useful if you just want something simple to work with; for that, JPGs are much more useful. Changing the default file format is also nice and easy though, so let’s do that. defaults write com.apple.screencapture type followed by a space, and then type the relevant format suffix like I said, I use JPEG, so for me it would like like this: defaults write com.apple.screencapture type JPG Finally, we need to save the settings that we’ve just changed, and for that we ned the following command, again copied into Terminal: killall SystemUIServer And that’s it. You should now have screenshots in a useful format, saved in a useful location. But I’m not quite done yet. Before I go, I’ll leave you with four more useful tips, that will soon have you using screenshots like a pro: Tip: 1 When using the ⇧⌘4 shortcut combined with the spacebar to capture windows, you can eliminate the windows drop shadow from the screenshot by using Option-click instead of regular click. Tip: 2 When using ⇧⌘4 to grab a portion of the screen, if you misjudge the initial point of your selection, hold down the spacebar before releasing the mouse button and you can reposition the entire selection area. Tip: 3 When making a selection with ⇧⌘4, press the Option key before releasing the mouse button and move your mouse around to resize the dimensions of the selection area from its centre point. Tip: 4 When expanding a selection area with your mouse, hold down the Shift key to lock the dimensions of the area except for the direction that you are presently dragging in."," use screenshots a lot in MacOS, and there are a few things that I have picked up over the years, so I’m going to break this answer down into two sections; Taking screenshots, and using screenshots.

Human population has never been 2.* To be fair, it made their math easier, and their philosophy too, on a half-serious experimental problem, but they took a pass on modeling any pre-Neolithic populations, on the grounds that it wouldnt make much of a difference anyway.   Even if they hadnt taken this pass, their numbers would be different. Both used benchmark years (e.g. 1750 had 795 million people, 1800 had 969 million people) and interpolate the growth in between by using the population growth equation [math]N(t)=N_0e^r^t[/math]. However, Haubs choice was to multiply the birth rate for each year times the population for each year and Ramseys was to use calculus to get the total number of person-years lived and divide by life expectancy.  Haubs number is much higher, even for just the last 2000 years (62 billion to Ramseys 48 billion, both updated to 2014), because it assumes a much greater number of infant deaths, especially in the early years. But this doesnt explain the long tail of the growth curve, not even visible on the chart below.  Wikimedia: El T (Public domain) Its not that there was no one around in the Paleolithic... the demographers have just taken a pass on an essential definition. What do we mean by human? Lets follow Ramseys method back to a few possibilities, all of them arbitrary of course. If we update to 2013, using a life expectancy of 60, Ramseys method gives 97.5 billion, but 19.6 billion of these are in the -1,000,000 to -9,000 period. Lets work with 97.5 billion - 19.6 billion = 77.9 billion since 9000 BCE, when agriculture was really starting to lift populations in small regions of the world.  If we start with human effective population size and accept a very high estimate of the Toba bottleneck [Ambrose-PDF], i.e. 10,000 reproductive females (Takahata et al., 1995; Klein et al., 1993;Erlich et al., 1996; Sherry et al., 1997). the total population in -71,000 could have been something like 30,000. According to Ramsey, the total person-years from A to B is [P(B)-P(A)](B-A)/{Ln[P(B)]-Ln[P(A)]}.  So ((7,500,000-30,000)(-9000-(-71000)))/{ln(7,500,000)-ln(30,000)} gives 83.9 billion person-years. Divide by a life expectancy of 25 and get 3.4 billion. So with an updated Ramsey, we get 81.3 billion since Toba (ca. 73,000 years ago), which works with the timescale of behavioral modernity, if you believe in that sort of thing. Does this include our Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors, and other Homo lineages throughout Africa and Eurasia weve not yet encountered? It gets messy from here. Without doing Haubs interpolations, but instead allowing for what his birth rate method does: push the life expectancy down to ~16, we can add to Haubs 107 billion since 8,000 BCE. and 5.2 billion from then back to Toba. That gives 112 billion and counting. Yes, not too much of a difference from the handwave, but you can take this calculation back to human-chimpanzee divergence if youre willing to keep guessing on population sizes. Do we reach a trillion hominoids?The significance is that both numbers are enormous. They are enormous largely because most of the people who have ever lived never became adults. Haub answered the question to address the common saying (incorrect) that more people are alive today than have ever lived (we are at about 7% given his assumptions), but if were just counting adults over 15, there are 4.4 billion alive today, which might be a fifth of the adults whove lived in the last 2,000 years.

Alternatively, use an electric beater to mix cold eggs completely and nuke for nine seconds per egg until just warm to the touch.3. Sauté the filling ingredients. First, try not to select more than two or three ingredients aside from cheese. Make sure that wet ingredients such as mushrooms and tomatoes get cooked long enough for the flavors to intensify and the surfaces to cease being watery.4. Lightly oil the pan with an oil that has a moderately high smoke point: ghee is good, or avocado oil. Pour the eggs into the pan. Shake periodically. Near the end of half a minute there will be a little liquid on the top. Tilt the pan to run this liquid to the edges.5. The moment there is no more liquid, add the hot filling ingredients, fold, and top with cheese. Move to a warmed plate and let rest about half a minute. Consider a dash of a hot sauce such as Cholula. Or some green salsa. Or just a dash of dried chervil. Here are some ideas for fillings. 1. Ham and cheese. A simple classic. Use a good sharp cheddar or a swiss cheese and a juicy ham with a good smokey flavor. Sometimes tomatoes or bell peppers can be added.2. Spinach and mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms under high heat until they get some color. Then toss in the spinach, adding enough salt to offstet its bitterness, a few pinches. I top this with swiss or gruyere cheese.3. Shrimp and avocado. The shrimp will have been precooked by boiling or steaming, and the avocado gets no cooking at all. Heat shrimp in olive oil with a touch of smoked paprika.4.

In general, a mental verb refers to a cognitive state. For example-I know the answer.She recognized me from across the room.Do you believe everything people tell you?States of Being Verbs Also known as linking verbs, state of being verbs describe conditions or situations that exist. State of being verbs are inactive since no action is being performed. These verbs are usually complemented by adjectives. For example-I am a student.We are circus performers.Please is quiet.Types of Verbs: Action Verbs Action verbs express specific actions, and are used any time you want to show action or discuss someone doing something. Transitive Verbs Transitive verbs are action verbs that always express doable activities. These verbs always have direct objects, meaning someone or something receives the action of the verb. Intransitive Verbs Intransitive verbs are action verbs that always express doable activities. No direct object follows an intransitive verb.

Standard poker hands are 5 cards that form ranked hands (mostly from most rare, to most common).  A higher rank hand beats a lower rank hand if both make it to the phase of being compared for rank.  Hands of the same rank are compared by the highest card used as part of the rank (As are generally high, except if they are used in an A-2-3-4-5 straight in which case the 5 is the high card, otherwise it is standard order for cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10/T, J, Q, K, A is the order from low to high) then by left over cards if still tied.  And then if still tied it can be a split pot where both players tie. From high to low these hands are:Straight flush.  All 5 cards the same suit and all 5 cards in a row.  The highest possible straight flush is AKQJT of the same suit and is called a Royal Flush and is the highest standard poker hand.4 of a kind.  4 of your 5 cards are of the same rank. When QQQQ2 is compared to JJJJK the QQQQ2 is higher because it is 4-queens which beats 4-jacks with the extra card no mattering.  If the 4 of a kind were the same (possible in games where you can share cards with opponents or where wild cards are possible) then the extra card matters.Full House.  Your 5 cards come in just 2 ranks with 3 of one rank and 2 of the other.  When you rank full houses you do so by the 3-card rank.  So QQQ22 is better than JJJKK.  If full houses are of the same 3-card then the rank of the pair matters.  So JJJKK beats JJJTT.Flush.  All 5 of your cards are of the same suit.  When comparing 2 different flushes, which suit they are doesnt matter, but the rank of the cards does matter.  So AT643 of diamonds beats KQJT8 of spades (because the A beats the K) while AK543 of spades beats AK542 of diamonds (because the A and A are tied, the K and K are tied, the 5 and 5 are tied, the 4 and 4 are tied, but the 3 and 2 are different).Straight.  All 5 of your cards are in a row, but they arent all the same suit.  So 6d 7h 8c 9h Td is a ten-high straight.  3-of-a-Kind.  You have 3 copies of one rank, and your other two cards are other ranks (not the same).  So QQQJ4 might be 3-queens.  As with other ranks the 3-of-a-kind are intraranked by the rank of the 3 so TTT32 is higher than 999AK.  If the 3-of-a-kind are the same then you use the other cards so TTTKQ is lower than TTTA2 because the T is tied and the A beats the K.2-pair.  You have 2 different pairs of ranks with a 5th card of a different rank.  So KKTT2 is two-pairs Kings and Tens.  You rank these cards first by the bigger pair, then by the smaller pair, then by the extra card.1-pair.  You have 1 pair of a rank and 3 different cards of all different ranks.  So AA852.  You compare these 1-pair hands by the pair rank first, then the extra cards.Nothing.  You have 5 different ranks, they arent all the same suit, and they arent all sequential.  So AQJ62 of not all the same suit.  You compare these hands by what there highest card is, moving to next highest rank when tied.  So KQ432 is higher than KJT98 because the Ks tie but the Q beat the J.Depending on the form of poker you make your hands in different ways.  You could do it by everyone just getting 5 cards and that is it.  But that is rare.  More commonly youll either have a draw element (you get 5 cards but you get the chance to discard some of your cards and get new ones) or an element where youll get more than 5 cards (often 7 cards) and be able to make the best poker hand from any 5 of those 7.  In westerns the game is usually 5-card draw.  In TV poker today and many casinos the game is texas holdem (where you end up with 7 cards, some of them shared with everyone, and want to make the best 5 card hand). A lot of poker games are played with partial information.  Which means you know something about the other players hands.  In Texas holdem this is done by:Everyone gets 2 cards that only they can see.  There is a round of betting.3 cards are dealt face up on the table that will be shared by everyones hand.  There is a round of betting.1 more card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is another round of betting.1 final card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is a final round of betting.If you survive to the end and a showdown against other players then youll compare your best 5 card poker hand mixing the 2 private cards you had at the start and the 5 shared public cards.  You can use any mix of 2 private, 3 shared or 1 private, 4 shared, or 0 private, 5 shared to make your hand (but if you use 0 private, 5 shared you will be at best a tie with the other players still in). In contrast, a typical game of 7-card-stud is played where there are no shared cards, but some of the cards are private, and some of the cards are face up and known to anyone (but only used by one player).  The steps here are: Everyone gets 2 cards facedown and 1 card faceup in front of them.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup (but it is just their card).  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 final card facedown.  There is a round of betting.In the end if multiple players are left for the showdown each player will make their own best 5 card hand from amongst their own personal 7 cards.  Because you can see 4 of their 7 cards face up you know that hand needs to use at least 2 of the faceup cards, so you have some hint about what their hand can be.  Further, you can know which cards cant be in their hand by eliminating the cards that other players had face up as well as the cards that you yourself have faceup as well as facedown. In all of these games you make inferences from the size and strength of the opponents betting actions (raising, calling, checking, etc.) as well as the inferences you can make about how strong their hands can be given what you know about which cards they have to be using and also physical demeanor of the opponent (tells).  In general, the strength of your hand then is less about where it is in the ranking of hands in an absolute sense but where it is likely to fall relative to your opponents on this particular hands (there are some hands where 3-of-a-kind is nearly certain or certain to be the winning hands, there are others where a flush might be quite likely to be a losing hand). Your goal is to win the hands where there is lots of money in the pot, and avoid putting much money into the pots you dont win/that you lose.  The easiest way to do this is to fold your bad hands and also your ok and even good hands if someone else is betting a lot showing a great hand.  Folding means that at some point in the hand when someone makes a bet you decide not to match that bet and give up on the hand.  You now cant win the hand at all, but you dont need to put any more money in the pot.  If you look at all of those betting rounds in texas holdem and 7-card-stud folding early is both your most common move and, arguably, your most important skill and move.  For this reason a lot of games have some sort of blind or ante structure where some players need to put money into the pot early on no matter their hands or even if they have a bad partial hand showing. But you can also sometimes win by pretending to have a great hand and convincing everyone else to give up (and your opponent might be doing that to you).  There can also be situations where players tend not to fold much at all, but also tend not to raise much at all.  You can also be a winning player in some similar situations by just betting aggressively or a lot on your good and great hands, and having your opponents call you action (match your bet).  Now the pots when you have great hands might be $10 and the pots where you had less good hands and werent betting might be only $5.  If you win your equal percent of pots, but 80% of your wins are the $10 pots, youll win more money than you lose. So in general when someone bets money it could be:They have a better hand than you and want you to put more money in the pot so theyll win a bigger pot.They have a better hand than you right now, but they dont want you to keep playing in case you catch up, and they want you to surrender the pot right now.They have a worse hand than you and they want to trick you into folding.  This is known as bluffing.They have a worse hand than you right now, but they have some chances to have a better one if the right things happen, and they want to have you off balance or unsuspecting of it if they do get that better hand (something like 4 cards to a flush).Sometimes it is a combination of some of the above (especially 3 and 4 as a semi-bluff).  And sometimes the player is wrong about the ranking of the hands (I.e., they might think they are bluffing with a worse hand, but actually have a better hand.  Or they might think it is case 1 and they are building a big pot for their better hand, but only their hand is worse than yours and they are actually building your big pot for you). Poker is a very easy game to learn.  But can take more of an effort to get good at.  To be a professional poker player or a very good poker player there can also be a lot of skills to develop and master outside the direct poker game itself including emotional control (tilt control) for how well you deal with being unlucky or even lucky as well as critical skills like table/opponent selection (it is better to be the one-hundred-thousandth best poker player in the world playing against opponents who arent in the top million than to be the 50th best poker player in the world playing against just the top 10 best poker players) and also the importance of bankroll management. There can be also be many other variants of poker either with wild cards, or involving passing cards amongst opponents, or making low hands instead of high hands, or what not (some of these still quite serious poker variants, some more silly dealers choice home game only variants).  But in general it is always a combination of using betting with a ranking of the hands.","here are two parts of poker you need to understand: The making and ranking of poker hands.The betting and gambling part (including folding and bluffing).The first is the easiest, the second by far the more important.

You compare these 1-pair hands by the pair rank first, then the extra cards.Nothing.  You have 5 different ranks, they arent all the same suit, and they arent all sequential.  So AQJ62 of not all the same suit.  You compare these hands by what there highest card is, moving to next highest rank when tied.  So KQ432 is higher than KJT98 because the Ks tie but the Q beat the J.Depending on the form of poker you make your hands in different ways.  You could do it by everyone just getting 5 cards and that is it.  But that is rare.  More commonly youll either have a draw element (you get 5 cards but you get the chance to discard some of your cards and get new ones) or an element where youll get more than 5 cards (often 7 cards) and be able to make the best poker hand from any 5 of those 7.  In westerns the game is usually 5-card draw.  In TV poker today and many casinos the game is texas holdem (where you end up with 7 cards, some of them shared with everyone, and want to make the best 5 card hand). A lot of poker games are played with partial information.  Which means you know something about the other players hands.  In Texas holdem this is done by:Everyone gets 2 cards that only they can see.  There is a round of betting.3 cards are dealt face up on the table that will be shared by everyones hand.  There is a round of betting.1 more card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is another round of betting.1 final card is dealt face up to be shared with everyone.  There is a final round of betting.If you survive to the end and a showdown against other players then youll compare your best 5 card poker hand mixing the 2 private cards you had at the start and the 5 shared public cards.  You can use any mix of 2 private, 3 shared or 1 private, 4 shared, or 0 private, 5 shared to make your hand (but if you use 0 private, 5 shared you will be at best a tie with the other players still in). In contrast, a typical game of 7-card-stud is played where there are no shared cards, but some of the cards are private, and some of the cards are face up and known to anyone (but only used by one player).  The steps here are: Everyone gets 2 cards facedown and 1 card faceup in front of them.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup (but it is just their card).  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 more card faceup.  There is a round of betting.Everyone gets 1 final card facedown.  There is a round of betting.In the end if multiple players are left for the showdown each player will make their own best 5 card hand from amongst their own personal 7 cards.  Because you can see 4 of their 7 cards face up you know that hand needs to use at least 2 of the faceup cards, so you have some hint about what their hand can be.  Further, you can know which cards cant be in their hand by eliminating the cards that other players had face up as well as the cards that you yourself have faceup as well as facedown. In all of these games you make inferences from the size and strength of the opponents betting actions (raising, calling, checking, etc.) as well as the inferences you can make about how strong their hands can be given what you know about which cards they have to be using and also physical demeanor of the opponent (tells).  In general, the strength of your hand then is less about where it is in the ranking of hands in an absolute sense but where it is likely to fall relative to your opponents on this particular hands (there are some hands where 3-of-a-kind is nearly certain or certain to be the winning hands, there are others where a flush might be quite likely to be a losing hand). Your goal is to win the hands where there is lots of money in the pot, and avoid putting much money into the pots you dont win/that you lose.  The easiest way to do this is to fold your bad hands and also your ok and even good hands if someone else is betting a lot showing a great hand.  Folding means that at some point in the hand when someone makes a bet you decide not to match that bet and give up on the hand.  You now cant win the hand at all, but you dont need to put any more money in the pot.  If you look at all of those betting rounds in texas holdem and 7-card-stud folding early is both your most common move and, arguably, your most important skill and move.  For this reason a lot of games have some sort of blind or ante structure where some players need to put money into the pot early on no matter their hands or even if they have a bad partial hand showing. But you can also sometimes win by pretending to have a great hand and convincing everyone else to give up (and your opponent might be doing that to you).  There can also be situations where players tend not to fold much at all, but also tend not to raise much at all.  You can also be a winning player in some similar situations by just betting aggressively or a lot on your good and great hands, and having your opponents call you action (match your bet).  Now the pots when you have great hands might be $10 and the pots where you had less good hands and werent betting might be only $5.  If you win your equal percent of pots, but 80% of your wins are the $10 pots, youll win more money than you lose. So in general when someone bets money it could be:They have a better hand than you and want you to put more money in the pot so theyll win a bigger pot.They have a better hand than you right now, but they dont want you to keep playing in case you catch up, and they want you to surrender the pot right now.They have a worse hand than you and they want to trick you into folding.  This is known as bluffing.They have a worse hand than you right now, but they have some chances to have a better one if the right things happen, and they want to have you off balance or unsuspecting of it if they do get that better hand (something like 4 cards to a flush).Sometimes it is a combination of some of the above (especially 3 and 4 as a semi-bluff).  And sometimes the player is wrong about the ranking of the hands (I.e., they might think they are bluffing with a worse hand, but actually have a better hand.  Or they might think it is case 1 and they are building a big pot for their better hand, but only their hand is worse than yours and they are actually building your big pot for you). Poker is a very easy game to learn.  But can take more of an effort to get good at.  To be a professional poker player or a very good poker player there can also be a lot of skills to develop and master outside the direct poker game itself including emotional control (tilt control) for how well you deal with being unlucky or even lucky as well as critical skills like table/opponent selection (it is better to be the one-hundred-thousandth best poker player in the world playing against opponents who arent in the top million than to be the 50th best poker player in the world playing against just the top 10 best poker players) and also the importance of bankroll management. There can be also be many other variants of poker either with wild cards, or involving passing cards amongst opponents, or making low hands instead of high hands, or what not (some of these still quite serious poker variants, some more silly dealers choice home game only variants).  But in general it is always a combination of using betting with a ranking of the hands. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

However, having a good resume could be the difference between success and failure in landing your dream position. Here are some tips to help you not only tackle the task but also write a winning resume.Determine your job search objective prior to writing the resume. Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objectives as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don’t need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop.

However, having a good resume could be the difference between success and failure in landing your dream position. Here are some tips to help you not only tackle the task but also write a winning resume.Determine your job search objective prior to writing the resume. Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objectives as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don’t need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.Lead with your strengths. Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective. Put those strong points first where they are more apt to be read. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

Meteorites from the asteroid belt were used because they formed at the same time as our solar system and have not been subjected to melting and reforming by tectonic activity. Measuring lead isotopes is called lead-lead dating and was first done by Clair Patterson in 1956. I will explain how this method works graphically. See the appendix at the end of this answer if youre interested in the math. Isotopes are different forms of the same element. Isotopes must contain the same number of protons to be the same element. But they have different numbers of neutrons. Lead-lead dating is based on the fact that uranium isotopes U238 and U235 are radioactive and decay into lead isotopes Pb206 and Pb207 respectively. The number after the element’s symbol is the mass number, i.e. the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. The amount of Pb206 and Pb207 in a meteorite increases over time due to the radioactive decay of uranium. This means the age of a meteorite can be determined by the amount of its lead isotopes. The composition of lead in a meteorite is measured with a mass spectrometer. Here are the measurements for seven meteorites that formed in the asteroid belt and the location of their impact with Earth.Geochemists measured the ratios of Pb206 and Pb207 relative to Pb204 instead of measuring absolute values because a mass spectrometer can measure ratios more accurately. A ratio gives relative amounts. For example, there is 9.31 times as much Pb206 in the Canyon Diablo meteorite as there is Pb204. Geochemists chose to compare with Pb204 because it is not radiogenic which means the amount of Pb204 in a meteorite does not change with time. Expressing the measurements this way allows them to be graphed as Pb207/Pb204 vs Pb206/Pb204.The data points are color coded. For example, the Saint Marks meteorite is brown in the table. So its data point is brown in the graph. Notice the data points for the meteorites form a line. Geochemists call this line the isochron. The data points lie close to the isochron because the meteorites are the same age. The samples must come from a system of isotopic homogenization in order to get a true age using the isochron. That means the samples formed from the same material at the same time. This is true for meteorites that formed in the asteroid belt but not the case for a meteorite from Mars or the Moon. Another requirement is for the sample to remain a closed system. That is, no lead or uranium has diffused in to or out of the sample. The advantage of the isochron is it allows geochemists to cull those samples which meet the requirements from those that do not. The probability the data points lie close to the isochron by chance is effectively zero when you consider that over seventy meteorites are close to it out of less than a hundred meteorites sampled. I’m not a geochemist so I don’t know the exact number but that’s over 70%. The Canyon Diablo meteorite is of particular interest to geochemists. Patterson measured the present-day U238/Pb204 ratio of the Canyon Diablo meteorite to be 0.025. That is so low that virtually no radioactive decay occurred in this meteorite which means its initial and present-day ratios of lead isotopes are the same. So we can use the present-day Canyon Diablo lead ratios as the approximate initial lead ratios for all the meteorites. All the meteorites started out in the graph at the data point for the Canyon Diablo meteorite. Then the amount of Pb207 and Pb206 in the meteorites increased as they aged. Examine the curve for the Knyahinya and Juvinas meteorites below to see the increase. The data points for these meteorites lie along the green and blue curves respectively. Their position on the curve depends on the age. The first point on the curve is the lead ratios at age 0.75 Gy (billion years). The remaining points in order are for ages 1.5, 2.25, 3.0, 3.75 and 4.55 Gy. I show how this graph is calculated in the math appendix. For now, I just use it to explain how lead-lead dating works.We can see the amount of Pb207 and Pb206 in the meteorites increased as they aged. This is because of the radioactive decay of uranium. The increase in Pb206 is shown by the horizontal red lines. The increase in Pb207 is shown by the vertical red lines. Notice the amount of increase becomes less in both directions as the meteorites age. This is because uranium decays at an exponential rate. The amount of increase becomes less more quickly for Pb207 than for Pb206 because U235 decays over six times faster than U238. This caused the slope of the isochron to decrease as the meteorites aged which means we can use the slope to determine the age of the meteorites. Each meteorite has a different curve because the initial ratios of U235 and U238 varied by meteorite. But all the meteorites had the same initial ratios of Pb207 and Pb206. The explanation is found in the origin of meteorites and planetesimals. Planetesimals are tiny planets that formed in the asteroid belt from cosmic dust grains when our Solar System began. Most meteorites are rocks thrown out from planetesimals when they collided. There are iron and stony meteorites and those in between depending on whether the rock came from the core or crust of its planetesimal. Iron meteorites had low initial ratios of uranium. Stony meteorites had much higher initial ratios of uranium. Initial lead ratios were evenly distributed between iron and stony meteorites. The difference is uranium is a lithophile (rock loving) element. Whereas lead is a metallic chalcophile (ore loving) element. Lithophile elements remained near the planetesimal’s surface because they readily combine with oxygen which makes a less dense material. Dense materials are found in the core while less dense materials are in the crust. Chalcophile elements were also found near the surface because they readily combine with sulfur. However, metallic chalcophile elements also mixed with iron in the planetesimal’s core. This resulted in lead being distributed evenly throughout the planetesimal whereas uranium was concentrated in its crust. The data points for the meteorites from the asteroid belt lie near the isochron but are not exactly on it. This is due to measurement error and variation in the age of the meteorites since planetesimals did not all form at exactly the same moment. Modern geochemists have calculated the slope and standard error of the isochron from the lead isotope ratios measured in over seventy meteorites. The standard error is a calculation of how far the data points lie from the isochron. Their calculations show the meteorites are 4.56 billion years old ± 50 million years. It takes some math to convert the slope of the isochron into an age. See the math appendix if you’re interested in how that is done. Earth is a little younger than the meteorites from the asteroid belt. This hypothesis is based on a study which indicates it took Earth about 20 million years longer than planetesimals to accrete from cosmic dust grains. Which makes sense since Earth is much bigger. So Earth is 4.54 billion years old ± 50 million years. Math Appendix Lead-lead dating is based on the radioactive decay of U235 and U238 into Pb207 and Pb206 respectively. The radioactive decay of uranium is calculated by the following equation.where Ut is the amount of uranium at time t, UI is the initial amount of uranium or the amount at time zero, e is Eulers number, λ is the decay-constant of uranium per year and t is the time in years. Make t equal present day (P) and rearrange equation 1,OrThe next equation calculates the amount of lead in a meteorite at time t which is equal to the initial amount of lead plus the amount of uranium that turned into lead which is the initial amount of uranium minus the amount of uranium at time t. Or stated mathematically,Make t equal present day (P),Combine equations 1.1 and 2.1,OrDivide both sides of equation 3 by Pb204 and specify the isotope mass numbers for both the U235 and U238 decay paths.Now rearrange and divide equation 3.1 by equation 3.2. The present-day abundance ratio of U235/U238 has been measured to be 1/137.88.Notice the left side of equation 3.3 is the change in Pb207 divided by the change in Pb206. That is the slope of the isochron. So we can substitute the left side of equation 3.3 with the slope of the isochron to derive equation 3.4.where m is the slope, λ235 is the decay-constant of U235 (9.85E-10/year), λ238 is the decay-constant of U238 (1.55E-10/year) and t is the present-day age of the sample in years. The slope of the isochron and age of the meteorites are the only two variables in equation 3.4. If we measure the slope then we can calculate the age. We could measure the slope from the graph in the main answer. But that wouldn’t be very precise. So geochemists calculate the slope numerically with a linear regression. For more information see Simple linear regression - Wikipedia. Equation 4 is a linear regression which fits a line to the data points and calculates the slope.where m is the slope of the line, n is the number of data points, x is the ratio of Pb206/Pb204 and y is the ratio of Pb207/Pb204. Calculate the sums for the linear regression.Now calculate the slope of the isochron with equation 4. m = (n*Σxy - Σx*Σy) / (n*Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2) m = (7*48658.09 - 536.73*363.94) / (7*74788.22 - 536.73^2) m = 0.6170 The data points do not lie exactly on the isochron. So the next step is to calculate the standard error with equation 5.where s is the standard error and n, x, y and m have the same meaning as before.s = sqrt(4.45E-6) = 0.00211 We can estimate the upper and lower limits of the slope for the entire population of meteorites using the standard error. This is not a hard limit but rather we are 99% confident the slope is between the upper and lower limits. Statistically speaking, we need the 0.995 quantile of the Student’s t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom to calculate the limits with a confidence interval of 99%. We need the t5 distribution since our sample has five degrees of freedom. The 0.995 quantile of the t5 distribution is 4.032. The upper and lower limits of the slope are calculated as follows. m = 0.6170 ± (t5 * s) m = 0.6170 ± (4.032 * 0.00211) m = 0.6170 ± 0.0085 0.6085 &lt; m &lt; 0.6255 Now calculate the samples’ lower limit of age with equation 3.4. m = (1 / 137.88) * (e^(λ235*t) - 1) / (e^(λ238*t) - 1) m = (1/ 137.88) * (e^(9.85E-10 * 4.526E+9) - 1) / (e^(1.55E-10 * 4.526E+9) - 1) m = 0.6086 The slope (m) equals 0.6086 (close to 0.6085) when the present-day age (t) is 4.526 billion years. Now calculate the upper limit of age. m = (1/ 137.88) * (e^(9.85E-10 * 4.566E+9) - 1) / (e^(1.55E-10 * 4.566E+9) - 1) m = 0.6256 The slope (m) equals 0.6256 (close to 0.6255) when the present-day age (t) is 4.566 billion years. Express as an age plus or minus the amount of error. (4.526 + 4.566) / 2 = 4.546 billion years 4.566 - 4.546 = +0.020 4.526 - 4.546 = -0.020 So the age of the meteorites is 4.546 billion years ± 20 million years. Our calculation for a sample of seven meteorites is close to the geochemist calculation for a sample of over seventy meteorites, i.e. 4.56 billion years ± 50 million years. The difference between the two calculations is 14 million years which is within the error range of both calculations. Of course, the more samples the better the estimate. I promised to show how the graph used to explain lead-lead dating was calculated. We don’t need that graph to calculate the age of the meteorites. But here is the explanation for those interested. We need to be able to calculate the lead ratios in a meteorite at any time t to make the graph. Remember equations 1 and 2, Combine the two equations,OrDivide both sides of equation 6 by Pb204 and specify the isotope mass numbers for both the U235 and U238 decay paths.We need to know the initial ratios of lead and uranium to solve equations 6.1 and 6.2. The initial ratios of lead are the same as the present-day ratios of Pb207 and Pb206 in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. That is 10.29 and 9.31 respectively. We can calculate the initial ratios of uranium by rearranging equations 6.1 and 6.2.For example, the initial ratios of uranium in the Knyahinya meteorite can be calculated from the present day ratios of Pb207 and Pb206 in the Knyahinya meteorite. That is 85 and 130.1 respectively and t is 4.546E+9 for present day. U235/Pb204 = (85 - 10.29) / (1 - e^(-9.85E-10 * 4.546E+9)) = 75.57 U238/Pb204 = (130.1 - 9.31) / (1 - e^(-1.55E-10 * 4.546E+9)) = 238.85 Once we have the initial ratios of uranium, we can calculate the lead ratios for a meteorite at any time t with equations 6.1 and 6.2. For example, the lead ratios for the Knyahinya meteorite at age 0.75 Gy are, Pb207/Pb204 = 10.29 + (75.57 * (1 - e^(-9.85E-10 * 0.75E+9))) = 49.76 Pb206/Pb204 = 9.31 + (238.85 * (1 - e^(-1.55E-10 * 0.75E+9))) = 35.52 Calculate the remaining lead ratios.Graph the calculated ratios from the above table and the measured present-day ratios to create the desired graph.","eochemists calculated the age of Earth to be 4.54 billion years old by measuring the composition of lead isotopes in meteorites.

So Earth is 4.54 billion years old ± 50 million years. Math Appendix Lead-lead dating is based on the radioactive decay of U235 and U238 into Pb207 and Pb206 respectively. The radioactive decay of uranium is calculated by the following equation.where Ut is the amount of uranium at time t, UI is the initial amount of uranium or the amount at time zero, e is Eulers number, λ is the decay-constant of uranium per year and t is the time in years. Make t equal present day (P) and rearrange equation 1,OrThe next equation calculates the amount of lead in a meteorite at time t which is equal to the initial amount of lead plus the amount of uranium that turned into lead which is the initial amount of uranium minus the amount of uranium at time t. Or stated mathematically,Make t equal present day (P),Combine equations 1.1 and 2.1,OrDivide both sides of equation 3 by Pb204 and specify the isotope mass numbers for both the U235 and U238 decay paths.Now rearrange and divide equation 3.1 by equation 3.2. The present-day abundance ratio of U235/U238 has been measured to be 1/137.88.Notice the left side of equation 3.3 is the change in Pb207 divided by the change in Pb206. That is the slope of the isochron. So we can substitute the left side of equation 3.3 with the slope of the isochron to derive equation 3.4.where m is the slope, λ235 is the decay-constant of U235 (9.85E-10/year), λ238 is the decay-constant of U238 (1.55E-10/year) and t is the present-day age of the sample in years. The slope of the isochron and age of the meteorites are the only two variables in equation 3.4. If we measure the slope then we can calculate the age. We could measure the slope from the graph in the main answer. But that wouldn’t be very precise. So geochemists calculate the slope numerically with a linear regression. For more information see Simple linear regression - Wikipedia. Equation 4 is a linear regression which fits a line to the data points and calculates the slope.where m is the slope of the line, n is the number of data points, x is the ratio of Pb206/Pb204 and y is the ratio of Pb207/Pb204. Calculate the sums for the linear regression.Now calculate the slope of the isochron with equation 4. m = (n*Σxy - Σx*Σy) / (n*Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2) m = (7*48658.09 - 536.73*363.94) / (7*74788.22 - 536.73^2) m = 0.6170 The data points do not lie exactly on the isochron. So the next step is to calculate the standard error with equation 5.where s is the standard error and n, x, y and m have the same meaning as before.s = sqrt(4.45E-6) = 0.00211 We can estimate the upper and lower limits of the slope for the entire population of meteorites using the standard error. This is not a hard limit but rather we are 99% confident the slope is between the upper and lower limits. Statistically speaking, we need the 0.995 quantile of the Student’s t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom to calculate the limits with a confidence interval of 99%. We need the t5 distribution since our sample has five degrees of freedom. The 0.995 quantile of the t5 distribution is 4.032. The upper and lower limits of the slope are calculated as follows. m = 0.6170 ± (t5 * s) m = 0.6170 ± (4.032 * 0.00211) m = 0.6170 ± 0.0085 0.6085 &lt; m &lt; 0.6255 Now calculate the samples’ lower limit of age with equation 3.4. m = (1 / 137.88) * (e^(λ235*t) - 1) / (e^(λ238*t) - 1) m = (1/ 137.88) * (e^(9.85E-10 * 4.526E+9) - 1) / (e^(1.55E-10 * 4.526E+9) - 1) m = 0.6086 The slope (m) equals 0.6086 (close to 0.6085) when the present-day age (t) is 4.526 billion years. Now calculate the upper limit of age. m = (1/ 137.88) * (e^(9.85E-10 * 4.566E+9) - 1) / (e^(1.55E-10 * 4.566E+9) - 1) m = 0.6256 The slope (m) equals 0.6256 (close to 0.6255) when the present-day age (t) is 4.566 billion years. Express as an age plus or minus the amount of error. (4.526 + 4.566) / 2 = 4.546 billion years 4.566 - 4.546 = +0.020 4.526 - 4.546 = -0.020 So the age of the meteorites is 4.546 billion years ± 20 million years. Our calculation for a sample of seven meteorites is close to the geochemist calculation for a sample of over seventy meteorites, i.e. 4.56 billion years ± 50 million years. The difference between the two calculations is 14 million years which is within the error range of both calculations. Of course, the more samples the better the estimate. I promised to show how the graph used to explain lead-lead dating was calculated. We don’t need that graph to calculate the age of the meteorites. But here is the explanation for those interested. We need to be able to calculate the lead ratios in a meteorite at any time t to make the graph. Remember equations 1 and 2, Combine the two equations,OrDivide both sides of equation 6 by Pb204 and specify the isotope mass numbers for both the U235 and U238 decay paths.We need to know the initial ratios of lead and uranium to solve equations 6.1 and 6.2. The initial ratios of lead are the same as the present-day ratios of Pb207 and Pb206 in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. That is 10.29 and 9.31 respectively. We can calculate the initial ratios of uranium by rearranging equations 6.1 and 6.2.For example, the initial ratios of uranium in the Knyahinya meteorite can be calculated from the present day ratios of Pb207 and Pb206 in the Knyahinya meteorite. That is 85 and 130.1 respectively and t is 4.546E+9 for present day. U235/Pb204 = (85 - 10.29) / (1 - e^(-9.85E-10 * 4.546E+9)) = 75.57 U238/Pb204 = (130.1 - 9.31) / (1 - e^(-1.55E-10 * 4.546E+9)) = 238.85 Once we have the initial ratios of uranium, we can calculate the lead ratios for a meteorite at any time t with equations 6.1 and 6.2. For example, the lead ratios for the Knyahinya meteorite at age 0.75 Gy are, Pb207/Pb204 = 10.29 + (75.57 * (1 - e^(-9.85E-10 * 0.75E+9))) = 49.76 Pb206/Pb204 = 9.31 + (238.85 * (1 - e^(-1.55E-10 * 0.75E+9))) = 35.52 Calculate the remaining lead ratios.Graph the calculated ratios from the above table and the measured present-day ratios to create the desired graph. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) → higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer → higher temperaturesMore droughts → More forest fires → more co2 → higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%. With the increase of energy absorption of 1.1% by 2.6 watts from 235 to 237.6 watts/m2, we can expect an increase in energy absorption by 3.3%. This is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans. With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes hundreds to thousands of years for newly thawn land to be solid enough to sustain roads, buildings and to become arable for agriculture. 5: What it is not One of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissions stay close to the surface and don’t enter the atmospherere.The only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%). Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2. So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years. That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air? This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:CO2 is a heavy gas, so it sinks in the atmosphere. - Great, that doesn’t change anything.CO2 lags temperature. - Yes, and as explained, it’s not the only cause of climate change (Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation, volcanic, geological activity), but those all remained unchanged while CO2 increased by 40%.Medival Warming Period - This was not a global phenomenon and a tiny temperature change of 0.2 degrees celcius.The temperature records were faked and temperatures in the past were pushed down and pushed up for the recent years so that it appears that the temperature changes were higher. - If you fact check, it turns out this gif just shows the differences for U.S. temperatures vs. global temperatures.Whither U.S. Climate?It was the sun. - No, the sun’s energy sent to earth decreased during the largest temperature increase during the last 200 years while CO2 increased by 40%. This literally only takes 1 minute to fact-check.You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking. This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them. Summary Earth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly. Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space. Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect. This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2. This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean. We can only try to slow down the cascading effect. All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.","here is only one fact that matters. It doesnt matter what 97% of scientists say, what Al Gore says or what NASA says. It’s a simple equation: 1: Energy coming in Earth constantly receives 342 watts/m2 of energy by the sun. That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less. 2: Energy absorbed Of those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2.

This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) → higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer → higher temperaturesMore droughts → More forest fires → more co2 → higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released → higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%.

She talks to you like any other friend when you meet but as soon as you get back home and chat with her online, she begins to flirt! It’s like, she’s a totally different person on chat. It’s maybe because she can never gather the courage to flirt with you in person. 11. She shows signs of jealously if you talk to other girls. She gets mad at you for giving another girl attention.

She sends you random chat messages and claims it happened by ‘mistake’ just to start a conversation in the middle of the night, while she really was just stalking you on Facebook and waiting for the green icon against your name to light up. She’s always trying too hard to not look eager to talk to you. 8. She laughs at the lamest of jokes you crack, jokes that nobody else finds funny, including yourself. Yeah, that’s adorable. 9. She tries to catch your attention by doing everything possible. She won’t take your calls one random day, she will ditch plans unexpectedly, and she will wander off from the group to take a walk alone when you’re out with your mutual friends, she’ll sit alone at a party pretending she’s really sad about something, hoping you’ll notice and give her some importance.10. She talks to you like any other friend when you meet but as soon as you get back home and chat with her online, she begins to flirt! It’s like, she’s a totally different person on chat. It’s maybe because she can never gather the courage to flirt with you in person. 11. She shows signs of jealously if you talk to other girls. She gets mad at you for giving another girl attention. And to hide her real feelings she always plays the you-don’t-have-time-for-your-friends-anymore card. 12. She tries to find ways to spend some alone time with you, even when you’re in a group. She will drag you along for a long walk with the excuse of going to the ATM when her wallet really is loaded with cash. And, it’s only you she chooses every time to accompany her!Read that somewhere! Your first choice should be asking her out!! |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

How do you get one?Thats an intense area of focus. While getting a boyfriend isnt terribly difficult (you can just throw yourself out there and wait to see who smacks you bottom), getting one for a serious relationship is so much harder.One thing we have to recognize is that the term man-child is becoming more and more apparent as the times move forward. People, once they have grown up, dont want to be grown-ups; they still want to be kids. They want to have fun and play around, and make tons of mistakes, and not have to suffer for it... It makes people rash, irrational, irresponsible, and potentially easy to fail you if the going gets tough. Granted, this isnt the case for EVERYONE out there; but it does count for a majority population.So... First thing you want to do is IGNORE getting the boyfriend part... Thats the easy part (I dont care what you say, it is the easy part). What you need to do is to determing what a serious relationship is, to you. Being serious requires a lot of maturity; this is off-set by the aforementioned man-children... men-children? Would man-childs plural apply to the man, the child, or both? Hmm... Anyways... Its really hard to find someone mature enough to handle a serious relationship early in their life. It takes experience, and plenty of hardships, to help someone gain enough maturity and/or wisdom to be considered serious. So... Where do you start? I would highly recommend, hold off on the boyfriend until you reach your mid twenties. Yeah, thats a long time for many people... But for most, earlier than that theyll tend to want to focus on partying, or doing the things that only adults can do (clubbing, alcohol, drugs, etc.). This will rear its ugly head when you want help cleaning up after said party first-thing in the morning. So yeah, wait for a bit of time. The older the man, the more experience hes had... Therefore, you have a fairly good chance of finding someone with restraint enough to know when enough is enough.Next... Work. A man with an income is a very beneficial target; even more-so if you, yourself, are working too. Try checking out some of the guys in your workplace, as theyll be the easiest to relate to with regards to the world as a whole. Open up and chat with them, maybe check out some of the stuff they talk about... Who knows, you might like playing Grand Theft Auto: N.Korea. After a little socializing, you could make friends with some of them, and maybe even expand to hanging about with them after work.Finally... Personality. While ugly guys arent necessarily the cream of the crop, some of them can be very respectful people overall. So dont let the physical appearances get to you. Granted, there are some circumstances where it could be deemed... Difficult... To find the guy attractive; but dont give up on him. Perhaps offer assistance, or keep open the friendship barrier with the possibility of future prospects with him? Either way, try and get a guy who has similar interests as you... But is also someone slightly different. The reasons for this would be that people from the other sides of life from you are ones who can both help you to experience, and help protect you from, your weaknesses... In a controlled manner. If you cant swim, for example, having a partner who is a good swimmer can fill you with confidence that being near water wouldnt be too much of a problem if you accidentally fell in. Now do you see why I said to wait?Its painful for many women to wait, especially when they look at their biological clocks. Having to deal with menstruation, the everyday stresses and jealousy that can come from a life without that other half that some people just inherit from existence... You know the ones Im talking about. The first love forever types... Its strange, but it happens.Life throws some really weird curve balls at you... But so long as you take the time to allow both yourself, and your prospective boyfriend, some time to grow before committing... Youll actually be helping BOTH of you out in the long run.

How do you get one?Thats an intense area of focus. While getting a boyfriend isnt terribly difficult (you can just throw yourself out there and wait to see who smacks you bottom), getting one for a serious relationship is so much harder.One thing we have to recognize is that the term man-child is becoming more and more apparent as the times move forward. People, once they have grown up, dont want to be grown-ups; they still want to be kids. They want to have fun and play around, and make tons of mistakes, and not have to suffer for it... It makes people rash, irrational, irresponsible, and potentially easy to fail you if the going gets tough. Granted, this isnt the case for EVERYONE out there; but it does count for a majority population.So... First thing you want to do is IGNORE getting the boyfriend part... Thats the easy part (I dont care what you say, it is the easy part). What you need to do is to determing what a serious relationship is, to you. Being serious requires a lot of maturity; this is off-set by the aforementioned man-children... men-children? Would man-childs plural apply to the man, the child, or both? Hmm... Anyways... Its really hard to find someone mature enough to handle a serious relationship early in their life. It takes experience, and plenty of hardships, to help someone gain enough maturity and/or wisdom to be considered serious. So... Where do you start? I would highly recommend, hold off on the boyfriend until you reach your mid twenties. Yeah, thats a long time for many people... But for most, earlier than that theyll tend to want to focus on partying, or doing the things that only adults can do (clubbing, alcohol, drugs, etc.). This will rear its ugly head when you want help cleaning up after said party first-thing in the morning. So yeah, wait for a bit of time. The older the man, the more experience hes had... Therefore, you have a fairly good chance of finding someone with restraint enough to know when enough is enough.Next... Work. A man with an income is a very beneficial target; even more-so if you, yourself, are working too. Try checking out some of the guys in your workplace, as theyll be the easiest to relate to with regards to the world as a whole. Open up and chat with them, maybe check out some of the stuff they talk about... Who knows, you might like playing Grand Theft Auto: N.Korea. After a little socializing, you could make friends with some of them, and maybe even expand to hanging about with them after work.Finally... Personality. While ugly guys arent necessarily the cream of the crop, some of them can be very respectful people overall. So dont let the physical appearances get to you. Granted, there are some circumstances where it could be deemed... Difficult... To find the guy attractive; but dont give up on him. Perhaps offer assistance, or keep open the friendship barrier with the possibility of future prospects with him? Either way, try and get a guy who has similar interests as you... But is also someone slightly different. The reasons for this would be that people from the other sides of life from you are ones who can both help you to experience, and help protect you from, your weaknesses... In a controlled manner. If you cant swim, for example, having a partner who is a good swimmer can fill you with confidence that being near water wouldnt be too much of a problem if you accidentally fell in. Now do you see why I said to wait?Its painful for many women to wait, especially when they look at their biological clocks. Having to deal with menstruation, the everyday stresses and jealousy that can come from a life without that other half that some people just inherit from existence... You know the ones Im talking about. The first love forever types... Its strange, but it happens.Life throws some really weird curve balls at you... But so long as you take the time to allow both yourself, and your prospective boyfriend, some time to grow before committing... Youll actually be helping BOTH of you out in the long run. And if all of the above sounds like too much hassle and youre primarily looking for the experience of a serious relationship early in life... Just be sure that the guys youre checking out are smart and capable. Enthusiastic, progressive, accepting, etc. So many positive traits that can secure someones position.

Luckily, there are some very simple natural methods that will diminish or even completely stop your snoring. And the best part is, they take very little effort and are mostly free. 1.	Sleeping on Your Side Most people are much more likely to snore when lying on their backs. So try rolling onto your side. When you sleep on your back, your throat muscles push against your airway, which leads to snoring. Keep in mind that sleeping on your stomach may prevent snoring, but it isn’t good for your neck. 2.	Don’t Take Sleeping Pills If you think tranquilizing yourself is going to help you relax enough to stop snoring, think again. These drugs depress the central nervous system, as well as relax muscles within your jaw and throat; this means that you’ll be more likely to snore. It is particularly important not to consume sleeping pills and alcohol together. 3.	Losing Weight If you are overweight, particularly if you are obese, the added pressure on your airways will end up causing you to snore. 4.	Use a Mouth Guard Since one of the biggest contributors to the snoring problem is a lax lower jaw muscle, this is precisely where a mouth guard can come in handy. If you’re interested in trying this, simply talk to your doctor or dentist. 5.	Treat Your Allergies Suffering from allergies means you’ll probably find it difficult to breathe through your nose, and this will make it more likely that you end up snoring. Make sure to work in the use of local honey every day. A spoonful in chamomile tea before bed will help relax you and build up resistance to the allergens that make you stuffy. 6.	Don’t Smoke Smoking wreaks havoc on the respiratory system – give it up if you don’t want to snore anymore. 7.	Schedules Are Important Healthy sleeping habits contribute to the prevention of snoring, so go to bed at the same time each night and make sure that you get plenty of rest.

Beginning with the first solution, removing the redundant peripharyngeal tissue- that is, the junk that gets in the way of breathing- is effective maybe half the time. Ive seen plenty of patients who have had surgery in the upper airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) yet still have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea Losing weight usually leads to improvements in nighttime breathing because it reduces the size of the enlarged structures.  The position of the airway can also effect air movement due to the effect of gravity. Sleeping in the supine position, or face up, tends to exercerbate snoring. Using air pressure (continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP) to hold the airway open is the most common method for limiting or eliminating snoring. A soft plastic mask or nasal pillows fit over or in the nose and is attached to a machine which creates a constant or variable pressurized airflow that essentially splints the airway open. For people whose obstruction is related to a large tongue, receding chin, or jaw irregularities, the use of a tongue or bite guard can make possible adequate air movement. Finally, not breathing will definitely put a permanent stop to snoring, though I dont recommend it. Obstructive sleep apnea is a possible if not probable consequence of loud continuous snoring, and its short and long term deleterious effects on health are many.

Ingredients - serves 6:     600g Atlantic salmon    15ml oil    2 medium carrots, diced    2 large stalks of celery, diced    1 medium onion, diced    375ml fish stock    250g mascarpone    3 egg yolks    1 egg    Zest of 1 lemon    1 large handful of grated Parmesan    1 small handful of chopped chives or parsley1. Heat a large frying pan with a lid and add in the oil. Add in all the vegetables, and cook for a couple of minutes, push the vegetable to the side of the pan and lightly fry the salmon for a couple of minutes, pour in the stock and cover the pan with a lid. 2. Bring the pan to a light simmer and cook for 3 – 4 minutes or until the salmon is just cooked through. Remove the salmon onto a plate and let the vegetables continue cooking until they are very soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, smash the vegetable with a fork until finely diced. 3. Break up all the salmon flesh and mix with the vegetables. Whisk the mascarpone with the egg yolks, the egg and season with salt, pepper, lemon zest and Parmesan. This should make a slightly thick paste. 4. Before you start layering the lasagne, put 50ml of fish stock (or keep some of the juice that you get from cooking the fish or make extra vegetable juice for this) into bottom of dish to make the lasagne moist.  5. Layer lasagne sheets with the vegetable, salmon, mascarpone and keep on doing this till all the mixture is used. Put some vegetable or fish liquid over the top. This lasagne should not be too high, just 3 layers. It should be an elegant not a bulky dish. Set oven at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and let the lasagne warm through gently for about 12 minutes. You might need to experiment with the amount of stock needed as different brands of lasagne can absorb different amounts of liquid when cooking. Keep an eye on the dish and add extra hot fish stock if necessary. 6. Serve sprinkled with the chopped chives or parsley. Delicious with steamed or grilled asparagus.

Recruiters spend an average of only about 6 to 8 seconds on each resume before deciding whether to invite a candidate for an interview. . The first 10-15 words of your resume are the most important; that’s how many words the average person can read in those 6 to 8 seconds. . The top one-third of your resume often determines whether a hiring manager chooses to keep reading or not. . Your professional / career summary is the section of your resume a recruiter is most likely to read. . Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for specific terms and key words. ATS search terms are mostly correlated to job descriptions. . Changing the wording of a keyword from the job description even slightly, for example, from “project management” to “project manager” could cause the ATS to eliminate you as it is a very sensitive system. . Many ATS cannot recognize abbreviations as common as “CIMA” “CPA” or “ACCA”. It is crucial that a job seeker needs to highlight any abbreviation in order to avoid any sort of elimination from the ATS. . Unusual fonts, spacing, and images can also throw off an ATS system and reject your application. . Typos can easily sabotage your resume. Recent studies from various employers showed that of the most common mistakes applicants make on their resumes, 48 percent are related to misspellings. Make sure you perform a final resume check before submitting. Conclusion Your resume is your passport to land a job in a new organization. The type of template you choose as you decide how to write a resume can help or hurt your chances of getting the job you want. Consider the expectations of your field, as well as your experience level. As you write your resume, working with a chronological format with standard headings and font choices will reassure employers with more formal corporate cultures that you are serious, well qualified, and ready to contribute. It will also clearly showcase your career trajectory at a glance.","esumes can be divided into five major sections.

Your professional / career summary is the section of your resume a recruiter is most likely to read. . Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for specific terms and key words. ATS search terms are mostly correlated to job descriptions. . Changing the wording of a keyword from the job description even slightly, for example, from “project management” to “project manager” could cause the ATS to eliminate you as it is a very sensitive system. . Many ATS cannot recognize abbreviations as common as “CIMA” “CPA” or “ACCA”. It is crucial that a job seeker needs to highlight any abbreviation in order to avoid any sort of elimination from the ATS. . Unusual fonts, spacing, and images can also throw off an ATS system and reject your application. . Typos can easily sabotage your resume. Recent studies from various employers showed that of the most common mistakes applicants make on their resumes, 48 percent are related to misspellings. Make sure you perform a final resume check before submitting. Conclusion Your resume is your passport to land a job in a new organization. The type of template you choose as you decide how to write a resume can help or hurt your chances of getting the job you want. Consider the expectations of your field, as well as your experience level. As you write your resume, working with a chronological format with standard headings and font choices will reassure employers with more formal corporate cultures that you are serious, well qualified, and ready to contribute. It will also clearly showcase your career trajectory at a glance. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.","The thought of writing a resume intimidates almost anyone.

Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objectives as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don’t need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.Lead with your strengths.

As your score improves, play people closer to your own score. When you play, watch what the other players do, and after a while you’ll start to recognize patterns. What pieces do they move at the beginning of the game? What kinds of defensive moves did they make when you were threatening to capture one of their pieces? What kinds of offensive moves did they do to take your pieces? Try to make mental notes of as many of these as possible, learn from them, and apply the good strategies to your future games. Once you’re comfortable with the basics of the game’s mechanics, then start reading up on basic chess strategy. Look up “chess openings” online and learned about the first 2 or 3 that come up, learn about “forks” and “double attacks,” and research basic endgame strategy. You can find all of these by doing your own searches on Google or by going through the chess.com app’s tutorial section which will cover all these things. (You might have to pay for one of their premium subscriptions, but trust me when I say their tutorials are really good). Keep playing a lot of games. Apply more and more strategies to your chess games as you learn them and continue to pay attention to what others and doing and learn from them, too. You should start to see your score improve by at least a couple hundred points. At this stage you’ll be ready to start thinking 2–3 moves ahead, anticipating what moves your opponent will make and already knowing what your counter will be. Thinking ahead is a painful, time-consuming process at first, but it will be second nature after your brain becomes accustomed to it and begins to recognize patterns without you even trying. From this point forward: wash, rinse, and repeat. Keep researching and keep learning, and start to play players who are 100–200 points ahead of you. Always challenge yourself. Once you’ve reached a score of about 1500 you should be in the top 1% of players on chess.com. This may take a couple years, but the satisfaction you’ll earn will be well worth it.","aby steps.

One-litre beer mugs ( German : Maßkrüge ) at the 2006 Oktoberfest in Germany The litre (international spelling) or liter ( American English spelling) (SI symbols L and l , [1] other symbol used: ℓ ) is a metric unit of volume . It is equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm 3 ), 1000 cubic centimetres (cm 3 ) or 0.001 cubic metre (m 3 ). A cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of 10 cm × 10&nbsp;cm × 10&nbsp;cm (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre. The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit . The word litre is derived from an older French unit, the litron , whose name came from Byzantine Greek —where it was a unit of weight, not volume [2] —via Late Medieval Latin, and which equalled approximately 0.831&nbsp;litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI, [3] although not an SI unit —the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre (m 3 ). The spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures is litre, [3] a spelling which is shared by most English-speaking countries. The spelling liter is predominantly used in American English . [a] One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram , because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ( 0&nbsp;°C ). [4] Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact. [5] Definition [ edit ] Some SI units of volume to scale and approximate corresponding mass of water A litre is a cubic decimetre , which is the volume of a cube 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres (1&nbsp;L ≡ 1&nbsp;dm 3 ≡ 1000&nbsp;cm 3 ). Hence 1&nbsp;L ≡ 0.001 m 3 ≡ 1000 cm 3 ; and 1&nbsp;m 3 (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the SI unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L. From 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;°C) and standard pressure . The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000 028 dm 3 . Additionally, the mass–volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the CGPM (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.

There are two main ways of taking a screenshot, depending on what you want to capture. If you want to manually select the area to capture, then the quickest method is to use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘4. This will change your cursor to a crosshair that you can then click and drag to make your selection. When you let go, the select area will be captured. If instead you want to capture the entire screen, then you can use ⇧⌘3. If you want to capture a specific window, then use ⇧⌘4, but this time press the spacebar. This will turn your cursor into a little camera icon. Click on any open window, and it’ll capture the entire window for you. If, however, you want more options, then you can use ⇧⌘5 to bring up the screenshot options. This allows you to capture the entire screen, the selected window, or the selected portion. You can also save a recoding of the screen, ether in its entirety, or a selected portion of it, as well as decide where you want to save the file, if you want to set a timer or not, or if you want the mouse cursor to show or not. Now, this is where it gets interesting. By default, macOS will save your screenshots to the desktop, but, if you’re like me, and you hate a cluttered desktop, there is an easy way to change this. First of all, you’ll need to create a folder to hold your screenshots; I have a ‘Screenshots’ folder in the ‘Pictures” folder. Then open up the Terminal app and copy the following, but do not hit ‘Enter’ just yet: defaults write com.apple.screencapture location Now drag your screenshots folder into the terminal app, and it should automatically fill in the folder’s path. You can now hit ‘Enter’. So, now we have decided where to save the screenshots, but we’re not done yet. By default, macOS will save screenshots as PNG files, which are lovely, but not terribly useful if you just want something simple to work with; for that, JPGs are much more useful. Changing the default file format is also nice and easy though, so let’s do that. defaults write com.apple.screencapture type followed by a space, and then type the relevant format suffix like I said, I use JPEG, so for me it would like like this: defaults write com.apple.screencapture type JPG Finally, we need to save the settings that we’ve just changed, and for that we ned the following command, again copied into Terminal: killall SystemUIServer And that’s it. You should now have screenshots in a useful format, saved in a useful location. But I’m not quite done yet. Before I go, I’ll leave you with four more useful tips, that will soon have you using screenshots like a pro: Tip: 1 When using the ⇧⌘4 shortcut combined with the spacebar to capture windows, you can eliminate the windows drop shadow from the screenshot by using Option-click instead of regular click. Tip: 2 When using ⇧⌘4 to grab a portion of the screen, if you misjudge the initial point of your selection, hold down the spacebar before releasing the mouse button and you can reposition the entire selection area. Tip: 3 When making a selection with ⇧⌘4, press the Option key before releasing the mouse button and move your mouse around to resize the dimensions of the selection area from its centre point. Tip: 4 When expanding a selection area with your mouse, hold down the Shift key to lock the dimensions of the area except for the direction that you are presently dragging in."," use screenshots a lot in MacOS, and there are a few things that I have picked up over the years, so I’m going to break this answer down into two sections; Taking screenshots, and using screenshots. There are two main ways of taking a screenshot, depending on what you want to capture. If you want to manually select the area to capture, then the quickest method is to use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘4. This will change your cursor to a crosshair that you can then click and drag to make your selection. When you let go, the select area will be captured. If instead you want to capture the entire screenContinue ReadingI use screenshots a lot in MacOS, and there are a few things that I have picked up over the years, so I’m going to break this answer down into two sections; Taking screenshots, and using screenshots. There are two main ways of taking a screenshot, depending on what you want to capture. If you want to manually select the area to capture, then the quickest method is to use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘4. This will change your cursor to a crosshair that you can then click and drag to make your selection. When you let go, the select area will be captured. If instead you want to capture the entire screen, then you can use ⇧⌘3. If you want to capture a specific window, then use ⇧⌘4, but this time press the spacebar. This will turn your cursor into a little camera icon. Click on any open window, and it’ll capture the entire window for you. If, however, you want more options, then you can use ⇧⌘5 to bring up the screenshot options. This allows you to capture the entire screen, the selected window, or the selected portion. You can also save a recoding of the screen, ether in its entirety, or a selected portion of it, as well as decide where you want to save the file, if you want to set a timer or not, or if you want the mouse cursor to show or not. Now, this is where it gets interesting. By default, macOS will save your screenshots to the desktop, but, if you’re like me, and you hate a cluttered desktop, there is an easy way to change this. First of all, you’ll need to create a folder to hold your screenshots; I have a ‘Screenshots’ folder in the ‘Pictures” folder. Then open up the Terminal app and copy the following, but do not hit ‘Enter’ just yet: defaults write com.apple.screencapture location Now drag your screenshots folder into the terminal app, and it should automatically fill in the folder’s path. You can now hit ‘Enter’. So, now we have decided where to save the screenshots, but we’re not done yet. By default, macOS will save screenshots as PNG files, which are lovely, but not terribly useful if you just want something simple to work with; for that, JPGs are much more useful.

The majority of the population use various mobile apps as part of their daily activities. Statista says nearly 230 billion apps have been downloaded since 2021. As a result, the idea of ​​creating your own app is a smart strategy to pursue. But how much does it cost to implement a mobile application these days? The most trusted mobile app industry study provided the following estimates for app development costs and timelines: The average minimum app development project cost is between $5,000 and $10,000. According to Clutch, the typical cost of creating an app can be much higher. Median app development costs range from $25,275 to $114,300 for iOS app development at $100 per hour, representing 1,143 development hours, according to a Clutch survey. According to VDC Research, the average cost of creating an enterprise app is $140,000. According to Clutch, the total app price can go up to $500,000 for complex feature implementations. Regarding app development timelines: Over 80% of mobile apps take more than three months to develop. According to the Out systems Survey, 40% of apps are built over 6 months. Available app cost calculators show the price range for complex multi-function mobile apps from $200,000 to $350,000. If the app is configured with basic features, it will cost between $10,000 and $50,000. The most influential factors which determine the final cost to build an app are:App functionality and purposeVendor type and locationApp development processSize and level of development teamComplexity and number of app featuresBack-end infrastructure, connected APIs and integrationsComplexity of UX/UI designInclusion of additional branded visual elementsDevelopment approach (native, mobile web, hybrid, etc)Number of platforms to be developed (iOS, Android, web, etc)Mobile platforms and devices supportedOngoing maintenance planVendor type and locationMobile App Development Cost: Update for 2022The question is still open.

Our team has also created a detailed investigation on the cost to build an app that lists estimates based on widely used app features, design complexity, and software development stages. As a result, our conclusion supports the main findings regarding the cost to develop an app in 2022. An application with a core set of features costs upwards of $60,000, while the complex mobile app development cost starts at $300,000. The table below illustrates the range of costs to build an app with timeline accordingly. The characteristics of a basic app imply the creation of an app without any added-value. A basic app consists of just the core features necessary for the app to function, and includes a basic design and UI elements. The product is represented on only one platform; iOS, Android, or Web. An example would be a calculator app. The full product represents a mid-level app for one platform with more advanced features and design and with some unique qualities, making the app stand out from competitors.

Easy to take tests to help students increase their intelligence on state-of-the-art technology trends and history etc. 8Practical subscription option to make the required course 8Chat window to get instant support on courses and fees etc. Factors which determine Byjus like Apps development cost: When one wants to create a Byju-like app, the first thing that stimulates his mind is how much it costs to develop a Byju-like app or how much money an app like BYJU Learning needs to construct. The cost of e-learning app development like Byjus depends on the following key parameters:Software Design:App design is one of the deciding factors of any cost of developing e-learning or m-learning software. The good design (UI &amp; UX) can encourage students to interact with the app over an extended period. Good design needs more investment, but in the long run, it offers several tangible benefits. AppClues Infotech has proven experience in designing and developing Byjus similar app at an affordable price.Mobile platform (Android &amp; iOS, etc.):Byjus like app development for the iOS platform will cost comparatively less than on the Android platform, as it allows iOS applications to test against fewer devices.Libraries and softwareMode of use by users of technology and resources can also contribute to the cost concept to some degree. Many libraries offer open-source components and software while others are paid for with subscription fees during development. You can consult with the e-learning mobile app development company you choose for more precise details about this factor.App sizeApp size refers to the total number of features and functionality the app may have that can be in the form of video lessons or texts. You can reduce the cost of the creation of apps by giving preference to core features only in the apps version 1.Mobile walletThe inclusion of a wallet in the main app removes several payment problems and enriches the customer experience.Post-Development ServicesThere is a range of app development companies providing a mature, robust package of services, including post-development maintenance, updates, and marketing. Therefore, if you find the proposal costly, you can ask your technology service provider if they provide any or all of these post-development services, too.App developers:The expense of creating an e-learning app like Byjus also depends on the geographic location of the developers, their experience, and their level of expertise. The cost of developing Byjus like app or any m-learning app is estimated on the following basic and advanced features along with the above factors. Conclusion The simple replica of Byjus educational app can be prepared for around $25,000 if outsourced to an Indian app development company based on the features and functionalities described above. If you want it to work on both iOS and Android devices alike, the average cost of an ideal device like Byju- will hit anywhere between $30,000 and $50,000. The ultimate cost, however, may vary slightly from the amount mentioned, depending on how many additional features you may expect the developers to build. The investment would be worth it since we can see how much Byjus success is. |pal:GetEmotiveWord()| user.",}, nil, nil, nil )

Suppose youre going to build an app in Android platform, you need to download Android Studio(IDE) as well as the SDK tools.  Step 4: Build the back end of your app. Now that your app has been defined pretty clearly, its time to work on the back end of your app. In this step you have to set up servers, databases and storage solutions as per your requirement.Step 5: Creating the App. Create the look and feel of the app. Generate a storyboard which is a visual representation of all your apps screens. Build the UI. Add components through which users interact with your app. Customize it. Finally, add functionality and integrate with the back end.Step 6: Testing &amp; Debugging. Now that your app is complete, its time for testing. Start the simulator and begin testing. If your app has crashed, you need to start figuring out what happened and why. This is a vast subject and there are countless reasons why your app may have crashed. Debugging can be tedious and time consuming and it makes your app error free and ready to be uploaded. Step 7: Release time! Congrats, you just made your own app, its time to make it live. Create a developers account with your respective app stores. Google’s Android charges $25 a year and Apple charges $99 annually. Do ask for feedback from the users and improvise."," hope that you are ready to ride the wave of application development.

In addition, there are territories who may have sole political control over an area, but themselves are controlled by a higher power, such as military defense or foreign relations. These include territories, possessions, and other dependencies. Countries with such areas include:Australia (Christmas Island, Cocos / Keeling Islands, Norfolk Island)China (Hong Kong, Macao)Denmark (Faroe Islands, Greenland)Finland (Aland)France (French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, New Caledonia, Reunion, St Pierre et Miquelon, etc.)Netherlands (Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten)New Zealand (Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau)Norway (Svalbard)United Kingdom (Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, etc.)United States (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, etc)Some territories, like Cook Islands and Niue, even send independent representatives to UN bodies, and vote separately from their home governments. Most of these even have their own immigration/passport control (such as Guam or Hong Kong).

In addition, there are territories who may have sole political control over an area, but themselves are controlled by a higher power, such as military defense or foreign relations. These include territories, possessions, and other dependencies.

It’s ALL ABOUT YOUR BODYS FAT STORING REGULATION. How the body stores or burns fat. This process is controlled by two hormones (insulin and glucagon) that work like scales. Too much insulin and you’ll store fat, no insulin and glucagon can do it’s job and burn fat. The proof that hormones control fat storing and burning is common knowledge in the medical world and is not controversial. Yes there are hormones that control hunger and feeling full but in the end it’s all about being a fat burner or sugar burner. Don’t eat refined carbohydrates, sugars and fructose Yes without a doubt that’s all you need to do. It’s the most natural way the body works. The ketogenic diet works this way. High fat, low carb works this way and fasting (eating nothing for at least 16 hours per day every week or so) all work this way. They lower insulin levels and raise glucagon levels. Those that say it’s unhealthy to try ketogenic seem to be promoting the current western diet that gives you a 1–3 chance of either high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. So I think we can assume that the ‘normal’ way to eat is actually not that healthy! Anyway I digress… To explain the Ketogenic diet in layman’s terms. Ketogenic comes from the word ketones, the fuel source the body uses instead of glucose. Be a fat burner not a sugar burnerGlucose burning is predominant as we live in a world of refined carbohydrates and sugars. But that’s not the natural way the body should run. When you eat meats (or protein from vegetables) and saturated fats you’re eating what the body is designed to eat. Quite simply you reboot your body to go back to being a fat burning machine.There are ZERO essential carbohydrates only essential fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.When you burn ‘ketones’ instead of glucose you are in ‘ketosis’ or put another way; you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.People that say ‘it’s hard to follow’ have NEVER been in ketosis as once you are in it you have no cravings for sugary or carbohydrate high food. It’s the diet where you lose the most and keep it off longer.Studies that say you gain the weight back on ALWAYS state ‘when the patient returned to their normal diet’ so yes ‘you put weight back on if you go back to sugar and carbs’It’s not the point, following a ketogenic lifestyle is for life. In the first 4 weeks you’ll lose around 14lbs. Make sure you drink water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to replace lost electrolytes from all the water retention being released. You can exercise in ketosis and there are so many health benefits. Why it worksFat storage is regulated by insulin. A hormone. Not by the amount of calories you eat.When you eat the process starts insulin secreting from the pancreas (actually just before you eat)Insulin puts energy from the eaten food into your muscles for instant energy then……any excess goes into the liver as ‘stored energy’ and then…Further excess is put into fat cells.Simple. This process is accelerated by sugar and refined carbohydrates. If you eat high fat low carb then this process is slowed down. There is no big spike or ‘‘sugar-high’ basically less fat gets stored and the potential for fat to be burned is heightened. Fat does not spike insulin nor does moderate amounts of protein Hence less fat storage Fat burning The process above is reversed and when the body goes into ketosis it’s much easier to burn fat as there is a key to losing weight and that key is having low insulin. Glucagon the fat burning hormone only enters the blood stream in the absence of insulin (Guytons medical physiology textbook, edition 6) It’s a great way to be healthy and stop fat accumulation. Forget ‘eat less, move more’ no proven scientific merit. ‘Joslin’s medical textbook.’ ‘Calories in being less than calories out’ does not work as the body simply lowers its basic metabolic rate to try to keep fat on. Anyone that has lost weight by calorie deficit or eat less move more has done it because (not by design) they’ve lowered their carbohydrates by simply reducing all food.
